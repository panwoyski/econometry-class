Abstract = {{Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system has emerged to offer an
   integrated IT solution and more and more enterprises are increasing by
   adopting this system and regarding it as an important innovation.
   However, there is already evidence of high failure risks in ERP project
   implementation, one major reason is poor analysis of the requirements
   for system implementation. In this paper the authors highlight the
   importance of requirements analysis for ERP project implementation, and
   also present a requirements analysis framework by applying Quality
   Function Deployment (QFD); this will support to conduct requirements
   analysis for ERP project. This framework is based on the application of
   Quality Function Deployment (QFD), by also incoporating Balanced
   Scorecard (BSC) and Value Chain Analysis (VCA). The QFD can be extended
   to establish a series of matrixes to provide a clear, step-by-step
   requirements analysis framework. This converts enterprise vision into
   the requirements analysis for an ERP project. The BSC is used in
   acquiring the generation of input for QFD ``whats{''} and creating a
   business overview when planning objectives for the enterprise. The VCA
   can be deployed in aiding the generation of ``hows{''} and ensuring that
   all key business processes that add value are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are integrated software
   systems for administration of all aspects of a business. A major
   hindrance to firms that wish to convert from existing legacy systems to
   ERP systems (such as SAP R/3) is that the process can take 12 to 18
   months. This is an especially daunting length of time for small to
   midsize companies. Many ERP software vendors and consulting firms have
   developed methods for rapid systems integration, which, it is claimed,
   can cut implementation time to as little as 5 or 6 months. In this
   article, we explore the experience of 4 small to midsize companies who
   implemented SAP R/3 using Accelerated SAP (ASAP), SAP's rapid
   implementation process.
   ASAP is a reference-process-based approach to implementing R/3. As such,
   it does not allow for extensive customization of business processes
   during implementation. Nevertheless, our study showed that R/3 can be
   implemented quickly and effectively in small- to medium-size firms. ASAP
   appears to provide the ingredients for a well-structured implementation
   project. By reducing project scope and complexity, it reduces consulting
   costs and project risks. By splitting the project into small units with
   clear short-term goals, it increases the motivation for the project
   team. Finally, it can form the basis for a continuous improvement effort
   in which business processes are tuned to the new ERP system.}},

   They promise to provide an off-the-shelf solution to the information,

   are plagued with much publicized failures and abandoned projects.
   Efforts to make ERP systems successful in organizations are facing
   challenges. The purpose of the study reported in this paper was to
   assess the degree of criticality of twenty critical success factors
   (CSFs) in ERP systems implementation, which were identified through a
   review of the literature. A survey was administered to managers, from
   seven Venezuelan corporations, who were identified as having a key role
   in ERP systems implementation in their firms. A factor analysis of these
   items identified three underlying dimensions. The findings of this study
   should provide to management of firms implementing ERP systems a better
   understanding of the factors leading to successful ERP implementation

Abstract = {{Using organizational information processing theory (OIPT), we suggest
   several factors that influence some of the enterprise resource planning
   (ERP) costs and benefits that organizations are experiencing. Though we
   do not attempt to address all important factors that contribute to an
   ERPs impact, we suggest two organizational characteristics that may have
   received insufficient attention in other ERP literature: interdependence
   and differentiation. High interdependence among organizational
   sub-units, contributes to the positive ERP-related effects because of
   ERPs ability to coordinate activities and facilitate information flows.
   However, when differentiation among sub-units is high, organizations may
   incur ERP-related compromise or design costs. We provide a case study
   that explores the viability of this framework. The case describes some
   local-level impacts of ERP and provides some evidence of the validity of
   the model. Unexpected findings are also presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents research into the use of network Quality of Service
   (QoS) technologies to improve the performance of Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP) systems. The paper explores state-of-the-art QoS
   technologies and implementations, and finally provides a framework for
   the provision of QoS for ERP systems that utilise Internet Protocol (IP)
   networks. Four individual case studies - including both leading ERP
   vendors and network technology vendors - were conducted. Cross-ease
   analysis confirmed that the traditional approaches for ensuring the
   performance of ERP systems on IP networks do not address network
   congestion and latency effectively, nor do they offer guaranteed network
   service quality for ERP systems. Moreover, cross-case comparative data
   analysis also reviewed existing QoS implementations and suggested that
   while QoS is increasingly being acknowledged by enterprises as an
   important issue, its deployment remains limited. The proposed framework
   focuses on providing a structured approach to implement end-to-end IP
   QoS that accommodates both ERP systems and their web-enabled versions
   based on traffic classification mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to explore whether enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) systems can provide an organization with a sustained
   competitive advantage. Using the VRIO framework of the resource-based
   model of competitive advantage, four questions are posed to consider
   this issue. Is the ERP system valuable? Is the ERP system a resource
   that is heterogeneously distributed across competing firms? Is the ERP
   system imperfectly mobile? And, is the firm organized to exploit the
   full potential of its ERP system? An examination of the existing
   research suggests that ER-P systems may not provide a competitive
   advantage based upon the premises of system value, distribution, and
   imitability. This is largely due to the `common systems' approach used
   for the implementation of most ERP systems. Instead, the source of
   competitive advantage may lie in the careful planning and successful
   management of ERP projects, refinement of the reengineering of the
   organization, and the post-implementation alignment of the ERP system
   with the organization's strategic direction. Suggestions for future
   research are offered. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software merges a firm's data,
   information flows and business processes into a single package. Vendors
   argue that ERP provides an extremely useful strategic resource to
   enhance competitiveness and make it possible for a firm to leverage its
   other resources more effectively and efficiently. In addition, they
   allege that ERP encourages a system-wide perspective that is a basis for
   collaboration and a systems orientation. However, an examination of ERP
   systems using criteria established in research on resource-based views
   of the firm and chaos/complexity theory indicates that these claims are
   overstated. Observation suggests that even if ERP is necessary to
   coordinate complicated, multifaceted operations, it is far from
   sufficient to promote a strong competitive position over the long term.
   Moreover, ERP systems fit best within mechanistic, clockwork
   organizations dominated by routine, highly programmed technologies and
   operations, yet it is the non-routine learning and change processes
   found in complex, self-organizing systems that enable firms to create
   distinctive competitive advantages from ERP outputs. ERP makes possible
   deep changes in relationships, culture, and behaviors that can be
   crucial sources of advantage in the knowledge economy, but the
   structures and cultures most able to achieve this level of change are a
   poor fit with ERP requirements. To reconcile this paradox, we propose a
   dual-core, loosely coupled organization that views ERP as an enabling
   technology to build and augment social and intellectual capital, rather
   than as an information technology (IT) solution for organizational
   inefficiencies. Propositions for using ERP as a foundation for social
   and intellectual capital formation are introduced. Implications for
   research and practice are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have the potential to
   integrate seamlessly organizational processes using common shared
   information and data flows. The implementation of ERP systems involves
   sophisticated business processes integration and conflicts between
   different departments of the organization. Furthermore, it also costs
   organizations a huge amount of money and manpower. Therefore, even major
   ERP vendors cannot guarantee the success of implementation.
   Consequently, how to implement ERP systems successfully in an effective
   and efficient manner is an imperative issue in the field of enterprise
   information systems. Major ERP package vendors have recently used the
   concept of Best Practice (BP), which is related to transfer the past
   successful experience to the new ERP projects, to make the
   implementation effective and efficient. In this paper, we investigate
   the influences of the BP through a structured inductive study of an
   international conglomerate by examining their successful implementation
   of ERP projects. It is not surprising that the results of this study
   indicate that transplanting BP from the parent company to subsidiaries
   indeed plays a key role on the implementation of ERP systems. The
   results also reveal that successful transplanting of BP has positive
   impacts on the success in ERP implication, through reducing the cultural
   discrepancies, boosting project efficiency, and empowering coordination
   of systems integration.}},

Title = {{An integrative framework for the assimilation of enterprise resource
   planning systems: Phases, antecedents, and outcomes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{81-90}},

Abstract = {{Many organizations are in the process of assimilating Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP) systems. While traditional ERP systems
   integrated core business processes, the new generation ERP systems also
   have the potential to link suppliers, customers, and business partners,
   to integrate value chain activities. Despite this, the critical success
   factors for ERP assimilation identified in the past literature do not
   focus on external factors including the possible role of external
   stakeholders in ERP assimilation. If case studies are any indication of
   the outcomes in ERP investment, insights already suggest that many
   attempts have not delivered the expected benefits, have failed
   completely, or will have high probability of failure. In light of the
   new found scope of modem ERP systems and disappointing assimilation
   reports, this paper proposes an integrative framework that may enhance
   chances for successful assimilation of ERP in organizations. The
   framework identifies the phases, antecedents (technology and business,
   internal and external), and outcomes as they relate to ERP assimilation.
   The key contribution of the paper lies in synthesizing and extending ERP
   assimilation literature by addressing the role of critical external
   antecedents in different phases of the assimilation process.
   Implications of our framework are outlined to guide future practice and
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated hospitals need a central planning and control system to plan
   patients' processes and the required capacity. Given the changes in
   healthcare one can ask the question what type of information systems can
   best support these healthcare delivery organizations. We focus in this
   review on the potential of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
   for healthcare delivery organizations. First ERP systems are explained.
   An overview is then presented of the characteristics of the planning
   process in hospital environments. Problems with ERP that are due to the
   special characteristics of healthcare are presented. The situations in
   which ERP can or cannot be used are discussed. It is suggested to divide
   hospitals in a part that is concerned only with deterministic processes
   and a part that is concerned with non-deterministic processes. ERP can
   be very useful for planning and controlling the deterministic processes.

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes typical problems met by software enterprises in
   project management (PM) in accordance with the sequence of project life
   cycle. These typical problems are as follows: insufficiency of
   requirement definitions; poor accuracy of the plans; low efficiency of
   resource management; disorder of the supervision and control of project
   procedures; and neglect of knowledge management, etc. This paper intends
   to analyze the causes of these problems; put forward principles to solve
   them. These principles include: project scheming catering to the
   stakeholders; project plans based on data analysis; dynamic management
   of project human resources; visualized project control; knowledge

Abstract = {{This paper discusses about the enterprise resource planning (ERP) market
   in India and the world. The current extension of ERP is e-CRM. The ERP
   market has become saturated and is on the decline; and emerging from it
   is the market for small and medium scale enterprises. ERP, especially in
   India, is being offered by small-localized players to small and medium
   sized firms customizing it to the needs and their pockets. Taking this
   cue, the big ERP players have also started offering complete solutions
   to the small firms. The paper illustrates this point by using the case
   example of Prathma, a modern blood bank in India. Prathma has been the
   first blood bank in India to use ERP to integrate its functions using a
   customized ERR This has installed a quality check in its day-to-day
   operations and has significantly lowered costs. The findings of this
   study indicate that ERP systems promises benefit from increased
   efficiency to improved quality; productivity, and profitability.}},

Abstract = {{Various figures have stated that ERP (enterprise resource planning)
   systems have become one of the largest IT investments in recent years.
   The implementation of ERP system, however, is not an easy task. Previous
   research reports unusually high failure in ERP projects, sometimes
   jeopardizing the core operation of the implementing organization. The
   most famous case is FoxMeyer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   Further, ERP systems appear to present unique ongoing risks due to its
   uniqueness. In this study, we used a Delphi method to identify potential
   ERP projects risk factors, and constructed an AHP-based framework to
   analyze and then prioritized the ERP projects risk factors. The result
   reveals that some important risk factors deserve more attention during
   the implementation of ERP projects.}},

   using cluster analysis, different groups of ERP systems are classified
   to verify the correctness of the framework. The results may be useful

Abstract = {{Knowledge management is crucial to organizational survival and
   development, it is an important foundation of knowledge innovation of
   enterprise. The aim of implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   system is to construct a knowledge management system with core
   competence, and to realize the innovation of business process and
   organizational structure on the basis of knowledge management system. In
   the process of implementing ERP system, searching for the key points of
   innovation of business process reengineering and organizational
   structure is always the most crucial. As a thinking of systematic
   optimization, the theory of constraints (TOC) reveals the existence of
   system constraints, and should be a feasible method in the process of
   knowledge management and innovation. As a method of multi-attributes
   group decision-making and data fusion, combined weighted geometric
   averaging (CWGA) operator can be used to search for system constraints.
   The paper proposes a method of knowledge innovation by using CWGA
   operator to search for the system constraints, and then illustrates the
   feasibility of CWGA with an example. Meanwhile, the paper analyzes the
   methods of innovation of business process and structure of organization
   systematically as well, aimed for ERP and based on TOC, so as to drive
   the implementation process of ERP system, and to establish an effective
   system of knowledge management innovation.}},

Abstract = {{It has been decades that the information systems are widely applied in
   mineral industry to improve the business performance. However, while
   these systems have been improved incrementally over time, there is more
   and more pressure for the individual companies to gain overall control
   of these enterprise disparate systems. The new systems represent giant
   leaps in technology that can give the company great benefit, but it also
   means the great gap between the new and old system. There are two groups
   of problems: Integration and Reengineering. To address the problems, the
   pre-requisite is to understand the total system framework (function
   model, data model, system architecture model) and the information
   resource standards (data standard, information classification standard,
   database standard, etc), which in all can be defined as ``Information
   Resource Planning{''} (IRP). IRP will be the vital infrastructure to
   support the overall enterprise governance, and the core of IRP solution
   for disparate systems is data standardization. A methodology for
   developing the conceptual framework of IRP is introduced here. The final
   framework will be an extensible mineral information model with the
   associated Metadata stored in the repository, which accommodates the
   kinds of basic data entities that software tool can manipulate thus to
   support an enterprise wide information source planning and management.
   The model is fundamentally extensible in the sense that users are
   allowed to define new data entities and their types.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2004}},

Abstract = {{Much of the literature on enterprise systems implementation suggests
   that ERP systems should support the strategic objectives of the
   organization. In fact some ERP vendors tend to assume that implementing
   their products is a straightforward translation from strategy to
   IT-enabled business processes. But the strategic management literature
   reveals that corporate strategy is often contested terrain. Conflict
   over strategy has the potential to delay or derail ERP implementation
   efforts, leading to cost overruns, failures, and lack of expected
   benefits.
   This paper seeks to understand and explain how conflicts over strategy
   can affect the success of ERP implementations. We studied one firm's
   attempt to pursue information technology-enabled enterprise integration
   using critical ethnography. The firm is a small-to-medium sized
   enterprise within a large conglomerate in the Asia-Pacific region. Our
   findings show that, as the dominant actors and political agendas
   changed, so too did the company's enterprise integration strategy. The
   ERP system was designed to support a future corporate world and work
   environment that never arrived. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Reports are significant and critical deliverables from enterprise
   applications to end users. They provide summarized and concise
   information for end users to effectively capture resource status, track
   job progresses and analyze profit profiles, etc. Besides, they are also
   key documents for managers to communicate with customers, do planning
   and make decisions. Many customization efforts are needed to develop
   specific reporting functions for the targeted company while implementing
   an enterprise application. This paper proposes a configuration based
   method to configure and generate reports and a centralized approach to
   manage the reports in a secured manner, leveraged by the XML technology.
   Based on this method, the reporting functions can be built into a
   flexible and generic reporting service and integrated into enterprise
   information management systems. Implementers can tailor reporting
   functions for a specific company through configuration with less or
   without customization efforts. End users of the application can change
   report formats or configure new reports based on their new requirements.
   A prototype is developed in Java to verify and demonstrate the method.}},

Abstract = {{The body of research relating to the implementation of enterprise
   resource planning (ERP) systems in small- and medium-sized enterprises
   (SMEs) has been increasing rapidly over the last few years. It is
   important, particularly for SMEs, to recognize the elements for a
   successful ERP implementation in their environments. This research aims
   to examine the critical elements that constitute a successful ERP
   implementation in SMEs. The objective is to identify the constituents
   within the critical elements. A comprehensive literature review and
   interviews with eight SMEs in the UK were carried out. The results serve
   as the basic input into the formation of the critical elements and their
   constituents. Three main critical elements are formed: critical success
   factors, critical people and critical uncertainties. Within each
   critical element, the related constituents are identified. Using the
   process theory approach, the constituents within each critical element
   are linked to their specific phase(s) of ERP implementation. Ten
   constituents for critical success factors were found, nine constituents
   for critical people and 21 constituents for critical uncertainties. The
   research suggests that a successful ERP implementation often requires
   the identification and management of the critical elements and their
   constituents at each phase of implementation. The results are
   constructed as a reference framework that aims to provide researchers
   and practitioners with indicators and guidelines to improve the success
   rate of ERP implementation in SMEs.}},

Abstract = {{T his paper gives an overview of the theory and practice of planning and
   scheduling in supply chains. It first gives an overview of the various
   planning and scheduling models that have been studied in the literature,
   including lot sizing models and machine scheduling models. It
   subsequently categorizes the various industrial sectors in which
   planning and scheduling in the supply chains are important; these
   industries include continuous manufacturing as well as discrete
   manufacturing. We then describe how planning and scheduling models can
   be used in the design and the development of decision support systems
   for planning and scheduling in supply chains and discuss in detail the
   implementation of such a system at the Carlsberg A/S beerbrewer in
   Denmark. We conclude with a discussion on the current trends in the
   design and the implementation of planning and scheduling systems in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the trust-building mechanisms used between
   top-level managers, project team members, users, and outsourcers over
   the course of a project offering outsourced information systems
   development (OISD). Previous studies of trust were used to identify
   potential trust-building mechanisms for participants in OISD projects
   over three potential stages of trust building: deterrence-based trust,
   knowledge-based trust and identification-based trust. A case study
   approach was then used to explore the development of trust for
   individuals involved in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
   implementation for a US\$ 2.5 billion international manufacturing
   company. The results indicate that the various stakeholders did not
   encounter previously identified stages of building trust, but
   significant differences were found in the use of trust-building
   mechanisms among top-level managers, project team members, users, and
   outsourcers. Implications for scholars and practitioners are discussed.

Abstract = {{Given the significant impact of implementing enterprise resources
   planning (ERP), managerial adaptation of ERP offers a useful method of
   further maximizing the benefits of this system. This study employs a
   technology adaptation perspective and case research methodology to
   examine three dimensions of alignment between organization and ERP
   system. Four medium size electronic component manufacturers are
   selected, which are typical of domestic companies that could afford and
   implement ERP. From the findings of the case study, this research
   attempts to build a theoretical model of prescribing management
   strategies for implementing ERP. The findings indicated that the
   requirement for successful alignment between the system and organization
   falls into two categories. The alignment issues in the two categories
   help explain the working of process integration in the organization and
   also how to reduce the alignment gap. To summarize, this study proposes
   an adaptation framework containing a set of propositions and hypotheses
   to delineate the relevant research issues.}},

Abstract = {{To meet mid-level market demand for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
   packages, major ERP software vendors have streamlined their products to
   provide features tailored to the needs of mid-sized organizations. With
   numerous alternatives available, the selection of the ``best{''} ERP
   software package is frequently a difficult decision. Oftentimes,
   mid-sized organizations lack the necessary technical expertise to make
   such a decision. This study uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to
   analyze and compare the performance of several leading mid-level ER-P
   packages. The DEA model connects costs (inputs) to capabilities/services
   (outputs) to evaluate the relative performance of individual software
   packages. Unlike most approaches, DEA does not require a set of
   pre-assigned weights for inputs and outputs and, thus, overcomes the
   deficiency introduced by using arbitrary weights. The findings of this
   study provide information technology managers and consultants a toot for
   non-subjective assessments of mid-level EPR packages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extension to the technology acceptance model
   (TAM) and empirically examines it in an enterprise resource planning
   (ERP) implementation environment. The study evaluated the impact of one
   belief construct (shared beliefs in the benefits of a technology) and
   two widely recognized technology implementation success factors
   (training and communication) on the perceived usefulness and perceived
   ease of use during technology implementation. Shared beliefs refer to
   the beliefs that organizational participants share with their peers and
   superiors on the benefits of the ERP system.
   Using data gathered from the implementation of an ERP system, we showed
   that both training and project communication influence the shared
   beliefs that users form about the benefits of the technology and that
   the shared beliefs influence the perceived usefulness and ease of use of
   the technology. Thus, we provided empirical and theoretical support for
   the use of managerial interventions, such as training and communication,
   to influence the acceptance of technology, since perceived usefulness
   and ease of use contribute to behavioral intention to use the
   technology. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the extent to which the Small-to-Medium sized
   firms (SMEs) utilized their IT resources strategically, and also
   identified factors inhibiting such utilization. An attribute approach
   was adopted to identify attributes characterizing strategic IT
   utilization in SMEs. Seventy SMEs participated in the study and factor
   analysis was conducted to identify the underlying factors that explained
   the inhibitors of strategic IT utilization. While the results show that
   some SMEs utilize IT resources to reduce costs and improve customer
   services, many SME managers are still ignorant about their business
   environment. They do not use IT resources to create links with
   suppliers, neither do they use them to differentiate products/services
   nor to enable innovations. Lack of skills and knowledge to employ IT
   competitively emerged as the prime inhibitor of strategic IT
   utilization. Other factors were: poor planning; lack of resources; poor
   IT vision and leadership; and environmental uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations have the potential of
   significantly complementing the use of business-to-business c-commerce
   technologies. We consider the sources of this complement by drawing on
   transaction cost economics, and the theory of swift even flow. Analysis
   of 115 firms shows that perceived transactional efficiencies are greater
   for B2B e-commerce technologies in the presence of ERP, and are in fact
   magnified when ERP implementation specifically precedes B2B e-commerce
   initiatives. These findings imply a distinct system adoption strategy
   for firms pursuing e-commerce opportunities. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Being hailed as possessing the ability to drive effective business
   reengineering and management of core and support processes, it is not
   surprising that enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have been
   adopted by more than 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies at the turn of
   the century. In contrast, legacy systems have frequently been attached
   with negative connotations. Yet at the same time, it is common knowledge
   that some legacy systems are not replaced when companies adopt ERP
   solutions, while new in-house systems still continue to be developed.
   While risks and time involved have been highlighted as possible reasons
   for the non-replacement of legacy systems, little attention has been
   paid to process issues as well as the symbolic meanings attached to the
   ERP vis-a-vis the other coexisting information systems.
   This research employs symbolic interactionism as the informing
   theoretical perspective in an ethnographic study of a large government
   authority in Singapore. Our findings surprisingly indicate that contrary
   to popular belief, the end-users in that organization tend to attach
   rather favorable symbols to their legacy and new in-house developed
   systems, while displaying relatively negative sentiments towards their
   ERP package. In this paper, we first discuss the different symbolism
   attached over the years to the coexisting systems. Next, we highlight
   how certain symbols gradually got sedimented over time. Finally, we
   demonstrate how the consequent manifestations of these symbolic
   realities influenced certain organizational actions that impacted the
   usage and perpetuation of the coexisting systems.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits as well as the turmoil that the implementation of
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems creates for multinational
   companies are well known. Several reports and evidence through case
   studies underline both the difficulties and the resulting benefits of
   ERPs. This paper addresses the reasoning behind long implementation
   times and organizational thunderstorms that tantalise the deployment of
   ERP systems. It focuses on two aspects of most implementation projects
   that generate the majority of technical and functional problems and
   constitute the projects' bottleneck, i.e. code development within ERP
   systems due to key and unique requirements in a business environment,
   and localization and reporting needs that companies must adhere to or
   want to achieve. The approach proposes the classification of functional
   requirements into business critical and legally necessary, and the
   distribution of code development for system not fully supported
   processes among these two classes is discussed. Subsequently, the
   implementation times and deployment inefficiencies are coupled with the
   level of code development, and the difficulty of avoiding this for the
   two requirements' classes, mainly due to user inflexibility and local
   environment peculiarities, is discussed. Using the Theory of
   Constraints, a coherent methodology for handling bottlenecks and
   effectively planning the code development effort is proposed, and
   trade-offs are derived between successful and on-time ERP
   implementations with managerial enforcement of best practices fully
   functional within major ERP systems. The approach is verified through
   field data from an actual SAP R/3 implementation at the largest
   manufacturer of packaging products and equipment in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Entrepreneurs have to make decisions in conflicting issues e.g.
   long-term versus short-term, production versus marketing, and
   flexibility versus continuity in human resources. The long-term issues,
   in particular the innovation issue, need to be managed in a short-term
   context, recognizing that companies that thrive in chaos by constant
   innovation are the only ones to survive. In managing this innovation it
   is necessary to achieve an efficient and creative innovation process in
   which the risks have been analyzed and planned in order to avoid
   surprises.
   Scenario planning can assist such innovation processes by designing
   several scripts of the future. The entrepreneur formulates strategies
   for each scenario, based on the business idea of the company, i.e. the
   set of market-based concepts the enterprise offers. Thus, innovation is
   not only about products/services, processes and organizations, but it
   concerns the business idea of the company.
   We will show that the concept of the living company is appropriate for
   the implementation of scenario planning, in which we emphasize learning
   and autonomy. Such an approach enables an entrepreneur to manage
   innovation, the core of which is the continuing adaptation to market
   developments of the entrepreneur's business idea.}},

Abstract = {{To a large extent, trust determines expected utility derived from
   business transactions where the trusting party is dependent upon others,
   but lacks control over them. In many instances, this typifies the
   relationship between clients and an enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   customization vendor. This exploratory study examines how trust is built
   during an ERP implementation, and the relative weight of this trust
   compared with the perceived qualities of the implemented ERP itself in
   determining clients' assessment that the business relationship with the
   vendor is worthwhile. The data, collected from companies that were
   involved in the process of implementing a new ERP with the on-site
   assistance of a certain customization vendor, show that all three trust
   antecedents suggested by Zucker's seminal study of trust-process-based,
   characteristic-based, and institution-based mechanisms-contribute
   significantly to client trust.
   The data also show that client trust in this customization vendor and
   the perceived usefulness of the ERP both contribute to client assessment
   that their business relationship with the vendor is worthwhile, showing
   that both getting the job done and creating a trust-based relationship
   contribute to this assessment. The implications of the importance of
   creating trust in ERP implementation and the means of doing how to do so
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A key issue in enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation is how
   to find a match between the ERP system and an organization's business
   processes by appropriately customizing both the system and the
   organization. In this paper, we advance a framework for supporting
   management decision-making about customization choices and the
   capabilities required to accomplish them. In this framework, we identify
   various customization possibilities for business processes as well as
   ERP systems. We also identify technical and process change capabilities
   required for system and process customization. Combining customization
   options with change capabilities, we present a useful way for managers
   to identify feasible customization options for their particular
   organization. Such a framework also helps managers to recognize the gap
   between desired customization options and change capabilities. A case
   study is used to illustrate the application of the framework.}},

Abstract = {{An important problem in probabilistic description is to understand who
   are the key players, which activities associated with enterprise system
   implementations are important, and when their effect is most prevalent
   across the IT development stages. Using an information theory approach,
   we analyze the fit between their importance, as noted in the current
   literature, and the experiences reported by a cross-section of 116
   organizations that completed an enterprise system implementation
   experience. Our results suggest that the early literature- and
   case-based research on enterprise systems does not take into account,
   the importance of several key variables. These findings provide guidance
   to managers on how best to utilize their limited resources by employing
   such factors at the stage in the project's life cycle when they will
   have the greatest impact. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a resource-based perspective (RBP) model on
   enterprise recourse planning (ERP) challenges to help make ERP decisions
   in China. While ERP aims at integrating functional-area information
   systems within a company into a coherent, enterprise-wide, and
   web-enabled network, its implementation is especially challenging to
   enterprises in China because of high implementation costs, technical
   complexity, lack of information technology infrastructure, lack of
   well-trained employees, lack of incentives to state-owned enterprises,
   and a corporate culture different from that in the West. A RBP of a
   firm, however, posits that firms should compete on the basis of unique
   corporate resources that are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and
   unsubstitutable. Thus, this research assesses major ERP challenges in
   China based upon a three-tier decision process in pursuit of a
   sustainable competitive advantage. This RBP model is then embedded with
   data from a survey research to illustrate potential applications and
   managerial implications.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing intensive global competition and integration of the
   world economy, manufacturing firms have to reduce inventory level and
   operation costs, improve customer service to obtain competitive
   advantage against their competitors. Manufacturing companies are forced
   to adopt new methods to achieve the above objectives. Enterprise
   resource planning (ERP) system is one of the most widely accepted
   choices. Significant benefits such as improved customer service, better
   production scheduling, and reduced manufacturing costs can accrue from
   the successful implementation of ERP (Ang et al, 1995). However, the
   successful implementation rate is extremely low especially in China and
   many firms didn't achieve intended goals. Thus, it's necessary for ERP
   practitioners and researchers to investigate the reasons why the
   implementation success rate of ERP systems in China is so low. Prior
   studies mainly focus on critical success factors or single ERP
   implementation success measure without theoretical support. This study
   attempts to combine Ives, Hamilton, and Davis (1980) MIS research model
   and DeLone \& McLean's (1992) IS success model to develop an ERP
   implementation success model, identifying both generic and unique
   factors that affect ERP systems implementation success in China and
   Using Multiple ERP implementation success measures to assess whether an
   ERP implementation is a success or failure.}},

Abstract = {{Expressiveness is applied to evaluate languages or descriptions. By
   expressiveness we mean what can be said within the limitations of some
   language. Assessing expressiveness is always based on a reference,
   namely the set of all things sayable, the things said in another
   language or the things that must be said to meet a certain purpose. So
   far, only nominal, or ordinal measures of expressiveness have been
   proposed.
   In the approach presented here, a certain purpose serves as reference to
   evaluate expressiveness by a cardinal measure. The approach is derived
   from measuring similarity between binary vectors and employs results
   concerning the formal semantics of logical descriptions. By applying
   this approach to measure the expressiveness of the master data used by
   Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems on the one hand and
   Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems on the other hand it can be
   shown that in most cases the master data of APS systems do not possess
   higher expressiveness than the master data of ERP systems.}},

   Processing, 80(3), 160; Badell \& Puigjaner (2001b). Advanced enterprise

   model with an advanced schedule algorithm using a MILP formulation. The
   modelling framework created can support the budgeting activity of the
   entire enterprise functionality, being now the budget the core document
   for enterprise management. The benefits of this work are shown through a

Abstract = {{In today's global manufacturing environment, manufacturing functions are
   distributed as never before. Design, engineering, fabrication, and
   assembly of new products are done routinely in many different
   enterprises scattered around the world. Successful business transactions
   require the sharing of design and engineering data on an unprecedented
   scale. This paper describes a framework that facilitates the
   collaboration of engineering tasks, particularly process planning and
   analysis, to support such globalized manufacturing activities. The
   information models of data and the software components that integrate
   those information models are described. The integration framework uses
   an Integrated Product and Process Data ( IPPD) representation called a
   Resource Independent Operation Summary (RIOS) to facilitate the
   communication of business and manufacturing requirements. Hierarchical
   process modelling, process planning decomposition and an augmented
   AND/OR directed graph are used in this representation. The Resource
   Specific Process Planning (RSPP) module assigns the required equipment
   and tools, selects process parameters, and determines manufacturing
   costs based on two-level hierarchical RIOS data. The shop floor
   knowledge ( resource and process knowledge) and a hybrid approach (
   heuristic and linear programming) to linearize the AND/OR graph provide
   the basis for the planning. Finally, a prototype system is developed and
   demonstrated with an exemplary part. Java and XML ( Extensible Mark-up
   Language) are used to ensure software and information portability.}},
