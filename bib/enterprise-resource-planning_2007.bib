Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) was originated in the manufacturing
   industry. It provides a general working environment for an enterprise to
   integrate its major business management function with one single common
   database so that information can be shared and efficient communication
   can be achieved between management functions. This paper briefs the ERP
   technology and its current development in general. Based on the needs of
   enhancing the core competitiveness of an enterprise, the construction of
   informatization is a best choice for the enterprise. However the unique
   nature of real estate enterprise in China prevents a direct
   implementation of existing ERP systems which are developed for the
   manufacturing industry. This paper underlines the characteristics of
   real estate enterprise and presents a real estate enterprise resource
   planning (REERP). Combined with a development of REERP, the authors shed
   light on the model, functions and architecture of REERP. Implications of
   our framework are outlined to guide future practice and research.}},

Abstract = {{Many semiconductor-related manufacturing enterprises in Taiwan have
   embarked upon the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   to integrate and optimize various business processes across the entire
   firm. The present study proposes a performance-evaluation model of ERP
   implementation utilizing fuzzy measures. The paper then presents an
   empirical study of semiconductor-related manufacturers in Taiwan in
   which the proposed model is used to: (i) identify the critical
   implementation items requiring improvement; and (ii) rank the strategies
   for improving them according to weight value. A systematic approach is
   thus proposed to: (i) examine the performance of an ERP implementation
   process; (ii) determine the items to be improved; and (iii) select
   appropriate and feasible strategies to improve these items. The proposed
   model can ensure successful implementation of ERP and thus enhance its
   potential benefits for semiconductor manufacturers.}},

Abstract = {{In application of enterprise resource planning (ERP), the accuracy,
   timeliness and consistency of the business data are the key factors
   effecting normal operation of ERP system. The policy of vendor managed
   inventory (VMI) is applied in the engine work, which has brought changes
   in the management processes in sales, planning and inventory. This has
   led to the situation in which application of ERP system couldn't meet
   enterprise practical demands. In order to protect the investment of ERP
   system in the enterprise, and adapt to the changes of outer and inner
   environment of enterprise, this paper puts forward with the VMI model
   based on the ERP platform. It has constructed the mixed system
   architecture of distributed VMI based on client/server model and
   browse/server model, by using personal digital assistant, barcode
   technology, wireless network, internet, which has realized the
   timeliness and the accuracy of data collection in acceptance, delivery,
   transferring on materials of purchase and sale. This paper has realized
   the integration of purchase planning, purchase acceptance, product
   delivery, material demand, sale delivery between ERP and VMI by using
   interface technology; it has enhanced the operating efficiency of ERP,
   and realized the information integration of vendors, manufacturers and
   customers among the supply-chain.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an account of the way Enterprise Resource Planning
   (ERP) systems change over time. These changes are conceptualized as a
   biographical accumulation that gives the specifi c ERP technology its
   present character, attributes and historicity. The paper presents
   empirics from the implementation of an ERP package within an
   Australasian organization. Changes to the ERP take place as a result of
   imperatives which arise during the implementation. Our research and
   evidence then extends to a different time and place where the new
   release of the ERP software was being `sold' to client firms in the UK.
   We theorize our research through a lens based on ideas from actor
   network theory (ANT) and the concept of biography. The paper seeks to
   contribute an additional theorization for ANT studies that places the
   focus on the technological object and frees it from the ties of the
   implementation setting. The research illustrates the opportunistic and
   contested fabrication of a technological object and emphasizes the
   stability as well as the fluidity of its technologic.}},

   managers, and have been acclaimed in the practitioner and academic
   literature for their potential to improve business performance. ERP
   systems provide benefits in the area of transaction automation; SCM
   systems provide more sophisticated planning capabilities. This paper
   focuses on the interactions between ERP and SCM. A conceptual framework
   was proposed. The framework is featuring the ERP benefits, firm
   competences, and supply chain performance. It became clear that there
   exists close interrelations in benefits of implementing ERP system and
   SCM performances. We apply rough set theory (RST) to discover important
   ERP attributes leading to the success of SCM.}},

Abstract = {{A key driver of the recent wave of enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   implementations was the assumption that the integration of business
   information would provide firms with a competitive advantage, yet
   concrete business benefits have been uneven across adopting firms. A
   possible explanation is that although the resource-based view holds that
   competitive advantage is derived from inimitable resources, ERP software
   has become a commodity. Socio-technical theory suggests that internal
   organizational resources based on a foundation of ERP technology may be
   the true drivers of ERP benefits. A firm's strategic configuration is
   posited to influence the portfolio of organizational competencies
   available to leverage the benefits of integrated business information,
   and a number of hypotheses are developed based on the notion that firms
   with different strategic objectives will realize different operational
   benefits from the adoption of ERP systems. Survey data from North
   American manufacturing firms that have implemented ERP systems
   demonstrate that ERP adopters seeking operational performance
   improvements are likely to realize these benefits. On the other hand,
   those seeking external market and supply chain performance improvements
   must first establish a foundation of internal operational performance
   improvements before customer satisfaction and supply chain benefits can
   be realized.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing enterprises are now moving towards open architectures for
   integrating their activities with those of their suppliers and customers
   within wide supply chain networks. Traditional knowledge engineering
   approaches with large scale or very large scale knowledge bases are not
   suited for such widely distributed systems. Agent-based technology
   provides a natural way for resolving this problem. This paper presents a
   multi agent intelligent architecture for modeling manufacturing
   enterprises so as to integrate design, planning, scheduling, simulation,
   execution, material supply, and marketing services into a distributed
   intelligent open environment. This paper proposes a multi-agent
   intelligent enterprise resource planning (MAIERP) system that uses the
   characteristics and capabilities of software agents to achieve
   enterprise wide integration. A software agent is a self-contained,
   autonomous software unit that performs assigned tasks from the human
   user and interacts/communicates with other applications and other
   software agents in different platforms to complete the tasks. Four types
   of intelligent software agents (interface agents, coordinating agents,
   planning agents, executions agents) are examined and argued in the
   proposed MAIERP system architecture. We demonstrate how the proposed
   MAIERP system takes advantage of existing information systems among
   various functional areas to achieve the system integration of available
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, while avoiding numerous
   problems encountered during a typical ERP implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly all information technology educators and practitioners are
   familiar with the concept of a systems development life cycle (SDLC).
   The SDLC model is mainly based on new software development. The stages
   vary based on methodology, but mostly include planning and requirements
   definition, analysis, design of the new system, implementation, and
   post-implementation support such as maintenance and security. Less
   explored and known are the stages involved in commercial off the shelf
   installation. The actual implementation of commercial off the shelf
   software ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems is an area that is
   suggested to have a life cycle of its own. The importance of specific
   phases of this ERP implementation life cycle is the subject of this
   study. By surveying SAP enterprise resource planning implementations at
   two divisions of a major manufacturing company, a confirmatory factor
   analysis confirms the existence of four distinct phases of ERP
   implementation - preparation and training, transition, performance and
   usefulness, and maintenance. In addition, the overall preferred ERP use
   is studied and compared with these factors. It was found that the two
   significant phases which directly influenced preferred ERP use were
   preparation and training phase, and performance and usefulness phase.
   Neither transition nor maintenance was found to significantly affect
   preferred ERP use. This suggests to practitioners that more focus needs
   to be placed on the key determinants of preferred ERP use - preparation
   and training phase, and performance and usefulness phase.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{2895-2917}},
Abstract = {{The manufacturing-marketing interface has received substantial
   consideration in the operations management literature. However,
   relatively little attention has been paid to the role of information
   systems in facilitating manufacturing-marketing integration. As
   integrated cross-functional systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems are well-suited to provide manufacturing-marketing integration.
   Based on information-processing theory, the central proposition of this
   paper is the greater the interdependence between manufacturing and
   marketing, the greater the benefit of ERP. Specifically, the first
   hypothesis (H1) states that the greater ERP-enabled coordination between
   manufacturing and marketing, the greater the benefit of ERP to the
   plant. The second hypothesis (H2) states that the degree to which
   ERP-enabled manufacturing-marketing coordination improvements are
   realized depends on the amount of interdependence between manufacturing
   and marketing. Using multiple regression, the model is tested on survey
   data from 107 manufacturing plants running ERP. The data support H1 and
   H2. These findings support the general proposition that interdependence
   between functions is one factor that influences the degree to which
   organizations reap benefits from their ERP investments. Based on the ERP
   literature, the model controls for the amount of time that ERP has been
   running in the plant; this factor was found to be insignificant in the
   model. However, exploratory analysis finds that time is associated with
   other ERP benefits.}},

   Group in 1990s, is the management thought with the combination of
   systematization and an application of modern information technique,
   which offers a management platform of decision means for the decision
   tier and staffs of the enterprises. ERP, as an advanced enterprise
   management system, is preferred by more and more enterprises. However,
   the implement of ERP system in China is far away from effective. There
   are only a few enterprises that can succeed in ERP implementation and
   reach the expected effects. After studying the successful and failed
   cases of ERP system implementation carried out by a great number of
   manufacturing enterprises, we summarized the main causes and the
   corresponding proposals to improve the rate of ERP system to be

Abstract = {{We studied the use of two types of graphic information visualization to
   support human operators performing tasks using enterprise resource
   planning systems (ERP). We compared the original display design of a
   commercial ERP system with a prototype information visualization design.
   A simulated supply chain was used to test the hypothesis that graphical
   visualization can improve the performance of the human operator using
   ERP systems for supply chain management. Tasks from the production and
   purchasing domains were tested in the experiment in which experienced
   and inexperienced human operators had to perform tasks of an easy,
   moderate, and difficult nature. Analysis of the results revealed that
   the two types of graphical visualization significantly reduced response
   time, particularly with inexperienced users performing difficult tasks.
   Our results imply that some graphic information visualization displays
   for ERP systems can increase the probability of a successful
   implementation and enhance the capabilities of the human operators. (c)

Abstract = {{Successful implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems
   has become a critical facilitator for efficient operations management in
   both developed and developing economies, The study presented in this
   paper uses a novel `' Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces `' (CCF) model
   developed in the context of global new product development projects, to
   examine the way that the interaction of factors relevant to project
   management contributes to successful ERP implementation processes. Based
   on regression analysis of responses from 244 small and medium-sized
   manufacturing firms in Taiwan and China collected in May 2006, we find
   that the balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces fosters ERP
   project success, a result which has significant impacts on ERP project
   management practice. The study also opens up a new direction for future
   research on ERP implementation processes in that it. suggests a novel
   way to model the interaction of project management factors. In addition,
   the new measures regarding project success and project management
   developed and validated in this study should prove to be useful for
   researchers studying ERP implementation processes. (C) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The new era of business information systems promises a sagacity of
   information flow among different modules and departments within an
   organization. In this context Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems
   or enterprise systems are playing today a crucial part and their
   advantages and benefits gained are noteworthy. Therefore the paper has
   analyzed and identified which are the key aspects of the ERP systems
   implementation such as their critical success factors and their
   characteristics using as a case study Electrolux that has continue to
   maintain their strategic advantage on the business market in spite that
   the competitors have implemented global ERP systems versus lite local
   ERP systems implemented by Electrolux. Based upon the review of other
   ERP systems implementation out research has looked mainly to highlight
   the processes streamlined by using local ERP systems that are integrated
   now in Electrolux which is in fact a global organisation. The main
   research questions addressed in the paper were looking to: (1) Highlight
   the characteristics of the ERP systems that are essential for any
   enterprise system and in particular in the case of Electrolux ERP
   system; (2) The examination of the different critical success factors of
   an ERP system implementation in order to improve the organization
   business information flow: (3) The investigation of how can
   organizations improve their practices in successfully implementation of
   their ERP systems. Finally the research paper it is analyzing why in the
   designing phase of different processes, it is important to involve both
   the customers and the users with their needs which in case of Electrolux
   has due to the increased of their benefits from ERP systems
   implementation locally.}},

Abstract = {{To solve the problem of the dynamic optimized allocation of the
   distributed manufacturing resources in the new manufacturing
   environment, a distributed decision-making approach based on mufti-agent
   system (MAS) was proposed. Through the negotiation of the agents based
   on market mechanism, optimized allocation of the distributed
   manufacturing resources was achieved when the equilibrium of the
   resource demand and supply was reached. The negotiation-based resource
   allocation process was initiated at the beginning of each time bucket to
   realize optimized resource allocation dynamically according to the
   current assignable tasks and available resources. Compared to the
   centralized and static planning mechanisms in the traditional enterprise
   resource planning (ERP), the approach can support distributed
   interactive decision-making of the internal and external decision agents
   and has the advantages of flexibility, dynamic adaptability, openness
   and reconfiguration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effectiveness of the implementation of
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) in improving service quality in the
   Taiwanese semiconductor industry by assessing the expectations and the
   perceptions of service quality from the perspectives of both upstream
   manufacturers and downstream customers. The study first establishes a
   modified service quality gap model incorporating: (i) the downstream
   customers' expectations and perceptions, and (ii) the upstream
   manufacturers' perceptions of the customers' expectations and
   perceptions. An empirical study by questionnaire survey is then
   undertaken to investigate the gaps proposed in the research model. The
   results show that service quality gaps do exist in the Taiwanese
   semiconductor industry between upstream manufacturers that are
   implementing ERP and their downstream customers. The study shows that
   the proposed model provides valuable guidance to manufacturers with
   respect to the prevention, detection, and elimination of the
   demonstrated service quality gaps. The model thus helps manufacturers to
   evaluate the contribution of various ERP modules to improved customer
   satisfaction with service quality and also provides guidance on
   improvement strategies to enhance service quality by eliminating quality
   gaps. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents the effect of investments in Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Customer Relationship
   Management (CRM) systems on a firm's long-term stock price performance
   and profitability measures such as return on assets and return on sales.
   The results are based on a sample of 186 announcements of ERP
   implementations, 140 SCM implementations, and 80 CRM implementations.
   Our analysis of the financial benefits of these implementations yields
   mixed results. In the case of ERP systems, we observe some evidence of
   improvements in profitability but not in stock returns. The results for
   improvements in profitability are stronger in the case of early adopters
   of ERP systems. On average, adopters of SCM system experience positive
   stock returns as well as improvements in profitability. There is no
   evidence of improvements in stock returns or profitability for firms
   that have invested in CRM. Although our results are not uniformly
   positive across the different enterprise systems (ES), they are
   encouraging in the sense that despite the high implementation costs, we
   do not find persistent evidence of negative performance associated with
   ES investments. This should help alleviate the concerns that some have
   expressed about the viability of ES given the highly publicized
   implementation problems at some firms. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   collecting all business areas in one system. For some organizations it
   is a necessity for doing business, while others use it to outperform
   competitors. Prior research in the area of ERP systems and competitive
   advantage is dispersed and insufficient. Based on literature review and
   in-depth interviews at two Norwegian enterprises we have developed a
   framework which we believe gives insight into the areas managers should
   focus on when implementing ERP systems.
   Our study supports the claim that ERP systems in themselves do not
   create a competitive advantage. Instead, they form an information basis
   which managers can utilize to outperform competitors. A good
   relationship between IT/IS managers and the rest of the management is
   crucial. The importance of top management support was highlighted and
   linking ERP and a data warehouse as a ``bolt-on{''} was very beneficial
   in one of the enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{Many enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation projects fail
   despite huge investments. To explain such failures, we draw on the
   resource-based view (RBV) of the firm to define various dimensions of
   information systems (IS) resources. Using resource-picking and
   capability-building arguments, we examine the relationships between IS
   resources and ERP capabilities to find out whether they have
   complementary effects on outcomes. Empirical results from a survey of
   manufacturing firms that recently implemented ERP systems support the
   hypothesized model. For IS research, this study further develops the
   complementary and capability-building roles of IS resources, integrates
   RBV into our cur-rent knowledge of ERP implementation, and provides
   theoretical explanations for when or under what conditions building ERP
   capabilities has the highest impact on business process outcomes. For IS
   practice, it emphasizes the importance of IS resources in building ERP
   capabilities, provides preliminary measures for IS resource dimensions,
   and demonstrates their impact on firms' ERP capabilities and consequent
   business process outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Although today a well-known Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System
   such as SAP can support many of the standard organization needs, the
   fact is that for many reasons most organizations prefer to change the
   ERP default configuration and/or complement the ERP with many other
   external applications, either existing or new ones. However, these
   external applications are still expensive to develop but especially to
   integrate with the ERP and even more expensive to change in order to
   support new business processes.
   In this paper we present an integration tool that we developed for the
   OutSystems platform called Integration Studio. This tool completely
   automates the task of integrating OutSystems applications with Net
   assemblies and relational databases. In addition, the tool was designed
   with an extensibility philosophy and was already extended to support
   easy integrations with SAP and Java. Other technologies, such as the
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), will follow soon.
   With Integration Studio, the OutSystems platform now supports not only
   the fast and easy creation and change of applications but also the easy
   integration of them with any other existing application in the
   organization. Furthermore, other non-OutSystenis applications can also
   access the OutSystems platform (e.g. using Web Services) to easily
   integrate with any OutSystems or non-OutSystems applications. With
   Integration Studio, the OutSystems platform is now a fully automated
   Integrated Services Environment (ISE) that, unlike the existing products
   in the market, is extremely easy to learn and use.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, firms around the world have implemented
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to have a standardized
   information system in their organizations. While millions of dollars
   have been spent on implementing ERP systems, previous research indicates
   that potential users may still not use them. This study, based on data
   from 75 potential end-users, examines various factors affecting users'
   behavioral intention to use the ERP system. The results indicate that
   subjective norms, perceived usefulness and education level are
   determinants of behavioral intention to use the system. In addition,
   perceived usefulness affects attitude towards use, and both perceived
   ease of use and compatibility affect perceived usefulness. Implications
   of these findings are discussed and further research opportunities
   described.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are packaged information
   technology (IT) suites that are increasingly becoming the price of entry
   for running a business, and such systems are gaining popularity
   worldwide. Researchers have discussed their adoption and implementation.
   Few have investigated the impacts of size, culture, and structure of the
   adopting organization on ERP system success evaluations. There is also a
   dearth of research on the effects of organizational IT issues or factors
   such as IT assets and resources (i.e., the IT department's value, the IT
   department's size, and the sophistication of the in-house IT
   professionals, among others) on ERP systems success. To our knowledge no
   study has investigated the interactions between these organizational IT
   issues and other contingency factors. To fill this gap in research, we
   designed an exploratory study to investigate the impacts of the
   aforementioned factors in the context of ERP systems success
   evaluations. Rather than considering the impacts of the three
   contingency factors on ERP success assessment alone, we incorporated the
   interacting effects of a few organizational IT issues which were
   selected for illustration purposes. Surveys were conducted in Finland
   and Estonia - two small technologically advanced Northern European
   countries. We obtained empirical data from 62 respondents in 44 diverse,
   private, and industrial organizations in the two countries. Using the
   structural equation modeling technique to examine the relationships, our
   analysis confirmed six of the eight hypotheses formulated. The data
   revealed positive relationships between organizational size, structure,
   and culture, on the one hand and ERP systems success, on the other.
   Also, IT resources (comprising of measures such as the IS budget size
   and size of the IT department) as a moderator in the relationships
   between the main contingency factors and ERP success was found be
   significant. The implications of the findings for both practice and
   research are discussed, and fruitful areas for future research outlined.}},

   (ERP) systems after a merger or acquisition in the oil and gas industry.
   A multiple case study method using primary and secondary data revealed:
   ERPs are operational necessities rather than strategic differentiators;
   best practice adoption is a viable alternative that supports successful
   integration of cultures and knowledge from two experienced
   organizations; schedules are extended when best practices from both
   companies are consolidated into a single instance; consolidation
   facilitates Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and lowers the cost of ownership;
   imposing acquirer systems on targets facilitates timely decision-making
   and shorter schedules.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2007}},

Abstract = {{Bearing in mind that activity requirements of manufacturing enterprises
   (MEs) can usefully be described as a network of dependent processes, the
   current paper identifies complementary properties of state-of-the-art
   enterprise modelling and simulation modelling techniques. It is observed
   that, when these techniques are used in a coherent fashion, they have
   potential to create semantically rich models of process networks that
   can be computer-executed so as to replicate and/or predict
   organizational behaviours. The current paper describes an outline of how
   a particular choice of well-proved enterprise modelling and simulation
   modelling techniques can be used in an integrated fashion. Also
   described are interim research findings when using such an integrated
   modelling approach in a case study furniture making company. For key
   segments of business processes currently deployed by the case study
   company, the outcome has been new qualitative and quantitative
   understandings about (a) alternative ways of organizing multi-product
   flows through a constrained (in situ) set of human and technical
   resources and (b) potential performance enhancements that could be
   achieved in process segments by purchasing, commissioning and deploying
   alternative systems of human and technical resources. Research
   groundwork is now in place to support the case study company as in the
   future it makes (a) medium-to-long term investment decisions about new
   manufacturing control strategies and the purchase of new resource
   systems and (b) short-to-medium term production planning and control
   decisions.}},

   pressures and the mediating role of top management}},
Journal = {{MIS QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-87}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We develop and test a theoretical model to investigate the assimilation
   of enterprise systems in the post-implementation stage within
   organizations. Specifically, this model explains how top management
   mediates the impact of external institutional pressures on the degree of
   usage of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The hypotheses were
   tested using survey data from companies that have already implemented
   ERP systems. Results from partial least squares analyses suggest that
   mimetic pressures positively affect top management beliefs, which then
   positively affects top management participation in the ERP assimilation
   process. In turn, top management participation is confirmed to
   positively affect the degree of ERP usage. Results also suggest that
   coercive pressures positively affect top management participation
   without the mediation of top management beliefs. Surprisingly, we do not
   find support for our hypothesis that top management participation
   mediates the effect of normative pressures on ERP usage, but instead we
   find that normative pressures directly affect ERP usage. Our findings
   highlight the important role of top management in mediating the effect
   of institutional pressures on IT assimilation. We confirm that
   institutional pressures, which are known to be important for IT adoption
   and implementation, also contribute to post-implementation assimilation
   when the integration processes are prolonged and outcomes are dynamic
   and uncertain.}},

Abstract = {{The market for enterprise systems (ES), continues to grow despite much
   speculation on its future after the slow down in the early 2000s. This
   study looks at the current ES implementation scenario in New Zealand
   (NZ). The purpose of the study is to gain insights into what is a
   typical case of ES implementation, to understand the current practices
   of ES implementations, and to do so through a `Practitioners'
   perspective{''} of ES vendors, ES consultants and IT research firms in a
   NZ context. Key findings indicate that although most large ES
   implementations have been completed by now, the ES market still shows
   progressive growth in the small to medium-sized enterprise sector for
   new implementations and upgrades or add-ons in all sectors. Many ES
   implementations in New Zealand are several years old now, however
   companies have only recently started tracking benefits through
   analytical processes to optimize and realize. business value from their
   enterprise systems investment. Implications for practice in
   implementation processes, implementation models and organizational
   contexts are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of information technology and the gradual
   extension of information technology to enterprise, ERP systems become
   more and more complex and some new requirements that focus on both
   manufacturing activities and the supply chain are brought forward. To
   address these problems, a MAERP system architecture based on SOA has
   been developed, in which the communication and information exchanges are
   realized between agents (based on KQML and SOAP) by means of
   Communication Switch Agent. To illustrate the architecture, a simulation
   work has been proposed and the results implied that the architecture
   provides a very efficient method to design ERP systems for small \&
   medium-size Enterprises with the purposes of scalability, extensibility,
   flexibility to achieve the business agility, reusability of the
   intelligent component, and cooperation between application systems to
   assure a global optimization. The objectives of this paper illustrate
   the architecture of ERP systems based on agent for small \& medium-size

Abstract = {{The object of the analysis here is to understand how to simultaneously
   maximize the value to customer and the economy of scale, for enterprises
   that rely on knowledge workers and digital production factors.
   Cyber-infrastructure, in this study, is defined to be the fusion of
   information technology and information resources, including the elements
   that integrate persons and the environment with the enterprises.
   Computerized manufacturing, e-commerce/e-business, and on-demand
   business/services all represent the evolution of
   cyber-infrastructure-based/assisted enterprises. The evolution is
   analyzed to be driven by a new mode of micro-economical production
   function: the Output-Input Fusing paradigm. In this context, the value
   to client/customer is acquired with on-demand co-production, and the
   economy of scale is achieved through concurrent co-productions with the
   assistance of the cyber-infrastructure. Basic principles for planning
   such enterprises are derived from previous results. A ``thought
   model{''} for the design, administration, and processing of the new
   cyber-infrastructure is presented. Particular new results, including a
   specific design for person-environment-enterprise interaction, are
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded Audit Modules (EAMs) have been the subject of discussion in the
   literature for more than two decades. Early implementations of EAMs were
   tied to proprietary accounting information systems and production
   systems. In recent years, there has been considerable development and
   widespread deployment of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that
   provide common business process functionality across the enterprise.
   These systems are based upon a common foundation provided by large scale
   relational database management systems. There has been no published
   research that addresses the potential for exploiting the perceived
   benefits of EAMs in an ERP environment. This paper seeks to, at least in
   part, close this gap in the research literature. The research is
   designed to assess the level and nature of support for EAMs by ERP
   providers.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of information technology and the gradual
   extension of information technology to enterprise, ERP systems become
   more and more complex and some new requirements that focus on both
   manufacturing activities and the supply chain are brought forward. To
   address these problems, a MAERP system architecture has been developed,
   in which the agents are classified into `Four types: F-Agent for
   realizing an operation application, C-Agent for coordinating with other
   agents, I-Agent for a communication tool between the user and the MAERP
   system, and T-Agent for performing specific tasks and data collecting.
   In this architecture, the communication and information exchanges are
   realized between agents (based on KQML) and software bus (based on
   CORBA) by means of Communication Switch Broker. To illustrate the
   architecture, a simulation work has been proposed and the results
   implied that the architecture provides a very efficient method to design
   and implement ERP systems for small \& medium-size Enterprises, in
   communication and cooperation between the functional application systems
   to assure a global optimization, flexibility of system, the ability to
   extend and reengineer, and the reusable ability of legacy systems in
   distributed and heterogeneous environments, has played a very important
   role.}},

Abstract = {{The present work presents a study on the application of business plans
   (BP) (a widely used document for investment decisions of new
   enterprises), with standard new product development processes (PDPs).
   The main objective was to find out whether it may be applied and, if so,
   at which moments it should be used in the PDP. The main source of
   information in this exploratory research was the existing literature
   concerning product and business development processes, business plans
   models and similar documentation, and project selection and evaluation
   methods. Then, these contents have been compared using the PDP stages as
   references. As a result, the study points out that a business plan is a
   document that models business, and it can gather enough information for
   investment decision analyses. It can also be elaborated concurrently
   with the PDP stages and used at the PDP decision gates. However,
   business dynamics has favored other forms of documentation for early
   decisions, such as synopses, presentations and even web-pages (for
   external resources). Business plan contents are still relevant and
   useful for new enterprises investment decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Successful implementation of new technologies and systems is vital for
   sustaining and enhancing the competitive position of an organization.
   However, many implementation efforts fail due to resistance or
   non-acceptance of new systems. This paper focuses on the factors that
   influence enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems implementation, it
   analyzes the critical factors that influence ERP implementation based on
   the interpretative structural model, and a multilevel stratum structure
   model for influential factors of implementing ERP is established.
   Therefore, it can be used to conduct pre- implementation analysis of ERP
   systems.}},

   perceived fit of the ERP system h significant impacts on his perceived
   usefulness And ease of use of the system. Second, user symbol adoption
   of ERP systems has significant impacts on the implementation
   effectiveness. These finding will help the manager to understand that
