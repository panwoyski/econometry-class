Abstract = {{Recently, in China, there is a tendency that many iron and steel
   enterprises incorporate into enterprises groups because of competitive
   pressure. In order to satisfy the demand of iron and steel enterprises
   group on group-oriented management pattern and to resolve the
   difficulties in management, control and scheduling on global resources
   and every enterprise incorporated. This paper proposes Group-oriented
   Enterprises Resource Planning (G-ERP) solution by reengineering the
   business process of iron \& steel group enterprises. G-ERP can make the
   integration and sharing on data, information and collaboration on
   business process of group domain, and can optimize the production and
   management of group enterprises under the multiregional, heterogeneous
   and distributed environment. The detailed design including hierarchy
   framework, system architecture and module interaction of G-ERP is
   represented. Finally, the implementation in an iron \& steel enterprises
   group of China is presented in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Continuously changing business environments require Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP) systems of modern manufacturing enterprises have the
   ability of agile reconfiguration to adapt to changes with quick
   responses. Based on a deep analysis of benefits that component
   technology provides to agile reconfiguration, the paper presents the
   architecture of component-based ERP systems in which the high efficiency
   for system construction and reconfiguration is supported by multiple
   grained component coexistence. A unified feature-oriented component
   model and the full life cycle of component-based ERP are then presented,
   and the paper expatiates on the process and artifices of ERP agile
   reconfiguration based on component reuse, with emphasis on component
   matching and selection problem, in which an approximately optimal
   component set is chosen from a component library by minimizing the
   matching cost to adapt to changes. Finally a practical case, i.e.
   reconfigurations on a production planning system, is put forward to
   validate the effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, many organizations have used business process
   modelling as an effective tool for managing organizational changes.
   However, process modelling has rarely been exploited for supporting the
   entire business process management life cycle. This includes the design
   of business processes as well as their implementation and control. The
   adoption and implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
   systems is a crucial issue if referred to small and medium-sized
   enterprises. The main problem is that the cost of implementation of ERP,
   intended as the process of customization of the ERP system towards the
   actual enterprise business processes, overtakes the cost of ERP
   acquisition. Thus, there is a need to use the same workflow systems for
   both modelling the enterprise business processes and designing the ERP.
   The paper presents the results of a collaborative project between
   academia and industry aimed at developing a business process management
   integrated approach to the design, implementation and control of an ERP
   information systems.}},

   production and distribution activities. To achieve these conflicting
   goals, companies must constantly re-engineer or change their business
   practices and employ information systems.
   In 1990s. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have emerged as an
   enabling technology, which integrates various functional (operations,
   marketing, finance) information systems into a seamless suite of
   business applications across the company and thereby, allowed for
   streamlined processing of business data and cross-functional
   integration. Thus, ERP systems provide an enticing solution to managers
   who have struggles with incompatible information systems and
   inconsistent operations policies. However, successful implementation of
   ERP systems requires active participation from senior-level managers
   from various functional areas so as to delineate its impact on the
   business level as well as functional level strategies.
   In this paper, we have endeavored to provide operations managers a brief
   overview of ERP systems and highlight its implications for operations
   function. Specifically, the objective of this paper is to give a broad
   based overview of enterprise resource planning systems. Using SAP R/3 as
   an example system, we discuss how an ERP system can assist in enhancing
   strengthening business strategy and making consistent operations
   decisions: process design, production planning and scheduling, inventory
   management, quality management, human resource management. (C) 2004

   reasons for the increasing popularity of the enterprise management
   perspective. Theoretical foundations are given that discuss vertically
   integrated, virtual and extended enterprises in terms of endogenous and
   exogenous factors, and the tensions that these create. An exploratory
   study in the German automotive industry using inductive grounded theory
   was conducted, involving data collection via 28 semi-structured
   interviews with 16 companies and data validation via a questionnaire
   survey receiving 110 responses from 52 companies. The research delivers
   a conceptual framework to show how enterprise structures emerge,
   depending on the prevailing type of core competencies that they use.
   Furthermore, it proposes contingency-planning recommendations to
   facilitate managing the change from one structure to another as the
   demands placed upon the enterprise change.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the details of an innovative postgraduate program,
   Master of Business (ERP), incorporating SAP R/3 System and related
   products that was introduced at the University of Western Sydney, NSW,
   Australia, in 1999. The program aims to develop integrative enterprise
   skills in a holistic business process management perspective, and
   provide ability to reengineer processes and implement an ERP system, in
   particular SAP R/3 system. The program has undergone continuous review
   to incorporate advanced dimensional products of SAP in order to improve
   its structure and the contents. As a result, this program has become one
   of the very popular ERP related postgraduate courses in Australia. This
   program explains the ERP concepts and contexts with the use of several
   SAP R/3 system application modules such as Materials Management (MM),
   Quality Management (QM), Production Planning (PP), Sales and
   Distribution (SD), Financial (FI) and Controlling (CO), and Human
   Resources (HR). The program also exposes students to work on other areas
   of SAP R/3 system such as Basis Technology, ABAP Workbench, Business
   Workflow as well as the advanced dimensional products such as Supply
   Chain Management (SCM), Business Information Warehouse (BW), Strategic
   Enterprise Management (SEM), Customer Relations Management (CRM), and
   Supplier Relations Management (SRM).}},

   in making decisions by modelling the operation of MECORP system. The
   methodology called process-oriented decision model (PODM) is presented
   in the paper. This uses an abstracted network to model MECORP system.
   The MECORP system supported by PODM, can effective optimize the manifold

   implementations. Some of these failed implementations may be attributed
   to the selection of an ineffective ERP system. This paper applies Data

   large-scale organizational change and what factors underpin differences
   in management attitudes and reactions. Through qualitative analysis of
   the introduction of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in two
   case study organizations, the authors argue that variations in
   managerial responses to organizational change relate to both the
   structural position of individual managers and their level of
   involvement in the implementation of change. Managers are also shown to
   exhibit agency in interpreting, influencing, and negotiating the impact
   of organizational change. The analysis emphasizes the need to
   incorporate more critical perspectives informed by labor process theory

Abstract = {{The selection of the appropriate analysis tools for survey data is an
   important decision for all researchers dealing with responses on
   questionnaires. Over the last two decades a number of approaches have
   been used for classifying variables, statistically measuring
   significance and developing predictions of outcomes. This paper compares
   and evaluates the use of regression analysis, logistic (logit) models,
   discriminate analysis and data envelopment analysis (DEA), for empirical
   data from a survey of enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations
   in the US manufacturing sector. The data collected from this survey
   contains a mix of subjective and objective data, and provides an
   opportunity to assess the impact of these modeling techniques on
   measuring outcomes and a decision-maker's acceptability of the results.
   The analysis illustrates that regression based tools are more valuable
   in developing predictive models, while logit and discriminate models are
   powerful in classifying the outcomes. The genetic search-based
   discriminate model is intuitively appealing, whereas DEA provides
   additional information with respect to understanding the process of
   arriving at the outcome over other tools. The analysis further shows
   that these techniques can be used in a complementary manner to insights
   that they cannot provide when used individually. In addition to the
   feasibility of these techniques, this analysis also provides important
   insights into ERP implementations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The paper addresses the issue of decision-making support for small and
   medium-size enterprises operating within a virtual project-driven
   enterprise environment. The problem considered here can be defined in
   terms of finding a feasible schedule that satisfies the constraints
   imposed by the work-order duration, the price, and the time-constrained
   resource availability. The problem belongs to the class of multi-mode
   case problems of project scheduling, where finding a feasible solution
   is NP-hard. A heuristic method for process planning and scheduling is
   proposed. The method is based on a critical path approach and the branch
   and bound search scheme. It has been implemented in a web-enabled
   interactive software package, and is illustrated using the example of a
   virtual construction enterprise.}},

Abstract = {{Being a complexity of nowadays information technology and brand-new
   management methods, ERP is a powerful tool nowadays and its influence is
   unambiguously comprehensive. Employing the process of ERP, Traditional
   Group Enterprise can integrate all its resources, for example: the
   resources of manpower, the linkages to its suppliers and distributors,
   the knowledge bases, the finance management, and the information system
   within organization.
   We study on Shijiazhuang Water Group Company, -explore how the
   Traditional Group Enterprise can apply the concepts of ERP to form an
   innovative, capital management model. After we investigate the
   strategies for integral capital management base on ERP, this paper ends
   with exploring the processes of setting up integral capital management
   base on ERP in the practical ways. And try to find the optimal capital
   management strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the economy in
   most countries. With the opening up of the economy, it is crucial that
   SMEs continuously improve their competitiveness to assert themselves in
   the global market. There is also a greater need for information
   integration in SMEs that lack the financial resources and business
   resilience of large enterprises. This research paper presents the
   development process of an effective decision-support framework for
   adopting integrated information systems within SMEs. The methodology
   comprises 11 steps, such as identifying information systems-related
   business problems, forming a project team, and assessing legacy systems
   and software vendors. The development process of the decision-support
   methodology has passed through four major stages: identifying the
   required specification of the methodology, selection and justification
   of the most suitable delivery medium, creating and evaluating a pilot
   version of the methodology, and developing the final decision-support
   methodology and the workbook in which it is embodied. An evaluation of
   the methodology concluded that it would help to improve the outcome of
   an integrated systems project by providing motivation, saving time,
   reducing risks, and assisting with decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Seven categories of critical success factors were identified from the
   ERP literature: (1) business plan and vision; (2) change management, (3)
   communication; (4) ERP team composition, skills and compensation; (5)
   management support and championship; (6) project management, (7) system
   analysis, selection and technical implementation. We conducted a case
   study of two organizations that had implemented and upgraded ERP
   systems. We adopted Markus and Tanis' four-phase model and compared the
   importance of these critical success factors across the phases of ERP
   implementation and upgrade. The importance of these factors across the
   phases of ERP implementation and upgrade is very similar. `Business Plan
   and Vision' and `Top Management Support and Championship' are critical
   during the Chartering phase. `ERP Team Composition, Skills and
   Compensation,' `Project Management' and `System Analysis, Selection and
   Technical Implementation' are most important during the Project phase.
   `Change Management' and `Communication' are very important during the
   Project and Shakedown phases.}},

Abstract = {{The development of cross-organizational enterprise resource planning
   (ERP) solutions is becoming increasingly critical to the business
   strategy of many networked companies. The major function of
   cross-organizational ERP solutions is to coordinate work in two or more
   organizations. However, how to align ERP application components and
   business requirements for coordination and cooperation is hardly known.
   This paper reports on the outcomes of applying a coordination theory
   perspective to an analysis of the ERP misalignment problem. We present a
   conceptual framework for analyzing coordination and cooperation
   requirements in inter-organizational ERP projects. The framework makes
   explicit the undocumented built-in assumptions for coordination and
   cooperation that may have significant implications for the ERP adopters
   and incorporates a library of existing coordination mechanisms supported
   by modern ERP systems. We use it to develop a proposal for how to
   achieve a better alignment between ERP implementations and supported
   business coordination processes in inter-organizational settings. We
   report on some early assessments of the implications of our framework
   for practicing requirements engineers. Both our framework and library
   rest on a literature survey and the first author's experience with ERP
   implementation. In future empirical research, we will further validate
   and refine our framework.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise systems (often referred to as enterprise resource planning
   (ERP) systems) can help organisations manage their key resources: money,
   staff, products, customers and suppliers, more effectively. Like many
   new technologies, ERP has been accompanied by vendor hype and stories of
   implementation failure. Work on critical success factors (CSFs) should
   encourage more appropriate implementation practice; however many CSF
   studies conclude with a list of factors but provide little further
   guidance. This paper presents a new model of ERP CSFs which draws upon
   existing work in IS innovation and on simulation ideas in order to
   better understand the relationships between CSFs and to encourage
   exploration of more appropriate implementation strategies. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The development of enterprise integration solutions requires the
   identification of core business processes, enterprise objects and their
   flows as well as essential resources and their use in day-to-day
   operations of an enterprise or of a network of enterprises. This paper
   focuses on the enterprise model creation process using the computer
   integrated manufacturing open system architecture ( CIMOSA) modelling
   framework, assuming that the models of the enterprise environment to be
   analysed are available in the form of data flow diagrams ( DFDs) or
   unified modelling language ( UML) use cases. The method mostly concerns
   the development of partial models and the specification of enterprise
   components to support knowledge capitalization about the enterprise
   structure and operations. Not only information-oriented models ( i.e.
   data schemas) are needed to support enterprise integration, but also
   models describing function, information, resource and organization
   aspects of the business. Planning and development of workflow
   applications also require such an approach. For these reasons, it is
   useful to start from DFDs or UML models, usually available in many
   companies or easy to draft from user explanations, and to adapt or
   extend them with the approach presented in the paper to plan enterprise
   integration projects or to analyse the business operations from an
   industrial engineering perspective.}},

   management in a commercial bank in Shanghai, China. The result of the
   study indicates that the most influential factors that affect corporate
   customers' satisfaction are customer relationship and service process.
   Both factors are served as inputs to knowledge management which
   generates some new ideas for improving customer services. CRM is a
   component of enterprise information systems. The study can be a
   reference to other commercial banks to improve their competence of CRM

Abstract = {{Green manufacturing is a modem manufacturing mode taking both
   environmental effect and resources consumption into account, which is an
   inevitable trend for manufacturing. Implementation of green
   manufacturing is a complicated systems engineering. Green integrated
   manufacturing system consists of green design system, green making
   system, quality control system, physical and energy sources system,
   environmental effect evaluation system, and management information
   system. Among them, information is the hinge connecting all the systems.
   Information for green manufacturing includes specific information,
   mutual information and public information. The information in a
   product's lifecycle is dispersed in different enterprises on different
   locations. To make full use of above mentioned information, an efficient
   information share model must be set up. Enterprise's information
   resource management model for green manufacturing clarified the whole
   process from gathering information, storing information, processing
   information for aided decision-making to producing outcomes in green
   product design, green process planning, manufacturing and usage.}},

Abstract = {{There are many benefits of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems,
   but their implementation is both complicated and difficult because the
   product spans functional silos and involves many internal and external
   entities. An ERP system is the outcome of social processes, and
   different ERP systems can embody distinct social arrangements when
   developed in different cultural contexts. Such social arrangements are
   difficult to change due the closure effect of technology stabilization.
   This leads to various misfit problems, both during and after ERP
   implementation, causing adverse effects on delivered ERP quality. With a
   survey of 85 ERP implementation cases in Taiwan, this study derives and
   empirically tests the main as well as the interaction effects of the
   country of origin of the ERP package, consultant quality, top management
   support, and user support of the ERP system quality as perceived by the
   client after implementation. The results demonstrate the important role
   of the country of origin of the ERP package and consultant quality in
   configuring a high-quality ERP system and alleviating the negative
   effect of misfit problems.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge is considered as an enterprise's invisible assets. Surviving
   in today's highly competitive and ever expanding global economy requires
   efficiently managing corporate knowledge. Increasing requirements for
   extended enterprises have stimulated the integration of knowledge
   management (KM) function into ERP systems for knowledge asset
   management. So far enterprise information systems such as ERP systems
   are developed and implemented for mainly managing physical assets of an
   enterprise since 1990s. Due to the fact that both types of assets need
   to be properly managed, the integration of KM and ERP becomes a
   strategic initiative for providing competitive advantages to
   enterprises. This paper discusses how to deploy KM and ERP concurrently
   in the framework of enterprise information systems, with a discussion of
   the interaction of KM and ERP systems in systems perspectives. Copyright

Abstract = {{The need to move from reactive to proactive resource planning has been
   highlighted by industry analysts, academia and enterprises. Proactive
   resource planning provides business users with a view of future jobs,
   which in turn will help them to plan their workforce utilisation
   appropriately in order to reduce costs and improve customer
   satisfaction. This paper presents the application of FOS, an integrated
   service management system, for managing the resources of BT. FOS
   incorporates applications for reliable workload forecasting, optimised
   workforce planning, as well as advance tools for visualising and
   communicating the outputs to end users.}},

Abstract = {{This research explores the value of a new form of enterprise, namely the
   extended enterprise in the new economy. To become an extended
   enterprise, an enterprise with a traditional Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP) system will need to upgrade or modify the existing
   system, and/or introduce Extended Enterprise Applications (EEA) into the
   system. This leads to the investigation on the potential benefits of
   using EEA. Interviews with EEA and ERP vendors and users are carried out
   to ascertain the concepts of an extended enterprise. The key results
   include the following: (1) manual operational tasks will be
   automatically managed by the EEA, and the system will even warn the
   enterprise if certain events did not occur or need to occur; (2) as
   supply chains become more integrated, and business processes are
   automated, the supply chain will require less day-to-day management; (3)
   the supply chain will be driven to manage exceptions, and the system
   will handle much of the `traditional operations'. This will mean more
   time to focus on improving the way the supply chain fits together,
   develop strategic alliances, reduce inventories, and improve
   productivity. The overall conclusion is that the use of EEA is expected
   to increase the supply-chain information velocity, greater product
   customization, and lower cost of doing business. However, some concerns
   have been identified in addition to those included in the questionnaire
   for the interviews, but the findings suggest that the avenue of becoming
   an extended enterprise is worth pursuing after considering the potential
   value obtained from using EEA.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - To examine enterprise resource planning (ERP) adoption in
   Greek companies, and explore the effects of uncertainty on the
   performance of these systems and the methods used to cope with
   uncertainty.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research was exploratory and six case
   studies were generated. This work was part of a larger project on the
   adoption, implementation and integration of ERP systems in Greek
   enterprises. A taxonomy of ERP adoption research was developed from the
   literature review and used to underpin the issues investigated in these
   cases. The results were compared with the literature on ERP adoption in
   the USA and UK.
   Findings - There were major differences between ERP adoption in Greek
   companies and companies in other countries. The adoption, implementation
   and integration of ERP systems were fragmented in Greek companies. This
   fragmentation demonstrated that the internal enterprise's culture,
   resources available, skills of employees, and the way ERP systems are
   perceived, treated and integrated within the business and in the supply
   chain, play critical roles in determining the success/failure of ERP
   systems adoption. A warehouse management system was adopted by some
   Greek enterprises to cope with uncertainty.
   Research limitations/implications - A comparison of ERP adoption was
   made between the USA, UK and Greece, and may limit its usefulness
   elsewhere.
   Practical implications - Practical advice is offered to managers
   contemplating adopting ERP.
   Originality/value - A new taxonomy of ERP adoption research was
   developed, which refocused the ERP implementation and integration into
   related critical success/failure factors and total integration issues,
   thus providing a more holistic ERP adoption framework.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most persistent and potentially far reaching, in terms of
   industrial benefits, problem in new product development, is the parallel
   and synchronous design and evaluation of the product, the production
   processes and the production network. The proposed theoretical framework
   for collaborative design and production network development is based on
   the concept of Digital Enterprise Technology (DET) and facilitates the
   integration of design and resource aware planning with aspects of
   network design and logistics. The controlling cycle of the framework is
   the DET-enabled, human centric evaluation of products, plans and network
   configurations that gives rise to an emergent synthesis environment.
   Early testing using aerospace products has been very encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation is a critical factor in the success of industrial companies,
   and just as important is the need to get innovative products to the
   market quickly. Therefore, it is important to talk about `management of
   product development time' because, under this new paradigm, companies
   able of `mastering' the development time will launch the product into
   the market just spending the planned time and resources and at the real
   moment. This will give back to the company higher market share and
   faster market penetration. The main objective of the project
   Acceleration of Innovative Ideas into the Market (ATM) is to provide the
   means of stimulating the creation of innovative ideas in general, and
   specifically on potential product/process improvements and on problem
   solving. These ideas are collected throughout the extended enterprise
   from people involved with the products and processes; this knowledge
   will be further developed into innovations in a project-basis process.

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of computer science and network technology,
   information technologies have been applied widely to manufacturing
   procedure of products. Computer aided process planning (CAPP), as a
   bridge to connect CAD and CAM, has been playing a key role in advanced
   manufacture fields, such as computer integrated manufacturing, agile
   manufacturing, virtual manufacturing, enterprise resource planning and
   product data management. With information technologies' extensive
   popularization and their application in the information manufacturing,
   CAPP technology is gaining more and more attention. Being associated
   with the production manufacturing environment and following closely with
   the advanced development of CAPP technology, this paper systematically
   studies the architecture, implementing methodology and the key technique
   of networked CAPP systems based on dynamic management of manufacturing
   resource. Finally, a prototype system is implemented with relationship
   database technology, PowerBuilder, SQL Server etc. Its advantages, such
   as feasibility, reliability, practicability, friendly interface,
   maneuverability, have been verified.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing organizations worldwide are re-inventing their product
   development practices in an effort to satisfy changing customer
   requirements. In the context of these changes influencing the
   manufacturing community, there is a need to develop frameworks,
   architectures, and methods to facilitate the creation, implementation,
   and functioning of virtual enterprises (VEs). This paper presents an
   Internet-based framework, which supports distributed process planning
   activities in the context of a VE. Typically, in a VE, the enterprise
   partners are distributed, and possess diverse skills and heterogeneous
   software resources, which employ heterogeneous computing platforms.
   Using the developed approach, physically distributed product development
   partners can collaborate virtually via the Internet and integrate their
   life-cycle product development activities through seamless information
   exchange. In this framework, the distributed manufacturing resources
   communicate with each other via the Internet inter-ORB protocol (IIOP)
   using an object request broker (ORB) at each distributed site.}},

Abstract = {{This paper looks at identifying factors affecting forecasting decision
   making in the supply chain of a government owned corporation (GOC), and
   how a recent Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) implementation
   was perceived by employees. It is argued that GOCs represent a distinct
   form of organisation and that ERP implementation strategies may need to
   modify some of their basic assumptions in order to be successful. The
   research approach consisted of two major steps. The first step
   identified 31. key personal in the supply chain and these people were
   interviewed to determine the level of need for decision support tools
   prior to the implementation of a new ERP. The second step involved
   conducting interviews with 16 of the original 31 staff and this was done
   after the ERP had been implemented for over a year. The feasibility of
   improving forecasting through the use of decision support system (DSS)
   and the degree to which the technology can assist forecasting in the
   supply chain was then explored. It was discovered that data accuracy was
   a problem. This was not associated with the ERP implementation, but
   rather with social factors such as different preferences among groups of
   staff on how to configure procurement and payment of invoices resulting
   in a lack of a consistent approach across the entire GOC. Further
   research studies are needed to determine if ERP implementation in GOCs
   represent a distinct population with special requirements.}},

Abstract = {{This is a multi-site case study of firms that have implemented
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. It examines eight dimensions
   of culture and their impact on how ERP implementation teams are able to
   effectively share knowledge across diverse functions and perspectives
   during ERP implementation. Through synthesizing the data, we develop a
   cultural configuration that shows the dimensions of culture that best
   facilitate knowledge sharing in ERP implementation. The results also
   indicate ways that firms may overcome cultural barriers to knowledge
   sharing. A model is developed that demonstrates the link between the
   dimensions of culture and knowledge sharing during ERP implementation.
   Possible research questions on which future research can be based are

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the influence of enterprise systems
   implementation on operational performance. The work extends the
   literature on enterprise systems by focusing on changes in process
   dynamics as a source for ongoing firm-level performance improvement. A
   case discussion of Tristen Corporation, a firm that implemented ERP and
   subsequently experienced benefits through gains to its continuous
   improvement efforts, is examined in light of theorized impacts of such
   implementations on process dynamics. Analyses of longitudinal data
   suggest that performance along a key metric motivating the ERP
   initiative (i.e., order fulfillment lead-time) showed a significant
   improvement immediately after system deployment. The data further
   suggest that the system implementation gave rise to an ongoing trend of
   performance improvement, in contrast to a stable performance trend prior

Abstract = {{At the beginning of 21(th) century there was a saying in China ``Using
   ERP (Enterprise Resources planning) is going to die, and rejecting ERP
   is waiting to die{''}, which depicts the dilemma of ERP application at
   that time. However, more and more enterprises in China have been
   accepting and implementing ERP during the recent years depending on IT
   (information technology) development and globalization. Therefore, how
   to succeed in ERP application is the real issue for the government,
   enterprises, software suppliers, consulting companies, even
   universities. This paper takes the application of K3 ERP in Tellhow
   Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (Tellhow) as an example to analyze the
   key elements for the success of implementation. Firstly, this paper
   presents the motive to accept ERP. Secondly, points out the principles
   of some key modules in K3 ERP, then analyzes the correct procedures in
   the course of implementation, such as prototyping, training, coding,
   data preparation, system switch, etc. Finally, this paper concludes some
   experiences and lessons for the followers.}},
