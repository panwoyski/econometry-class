Abstract = {{The realization of agile enterprises requires substantial development of
   the underpinning modelling, information management and knowledge
   representation technologies. This paper introduces a resource model that
   has been developed to support the dynamic, aggregate planning of
   manufacturing operations within large, complex production networks
   during the formative stages of design. The main goal of aggregate
   planning is the measurement of product manufacturability and the
   evaluation of alternative design configurations and manufacturing
   scenarios, through the allocation of multiple parts to remote facilities
   within the supply network. The term `resource aware' planning is used to
   indicate the creation of a dynamic interrelationship between the
   planning entities (products and processes) and the enterprise resources,
   including humans and machines. The technologies employed for
   implementing the pilot methods include the aggregate resource modelling
   methodology, a web-centric co-development environment, unique methods
   for enriching planning entities with knowledge and evolutionary
   computing methods for the rapid generation and optimization of
   production routes. A pilot resource aware planning system has been
   implemented that supports many innovative modes of operation, the
   initial testing of which was very encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{The continuing development of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
   has been considered by many researchers and practitioners as one of the
   major IT innovations in this decade. ERP solutions seek to integrate and
   streamline business processes and their associated information and work
   flows. What makes this technology more appealing to organizations is its
   increasing capability to integrate with the most advanced electronic and
   mobile commerce technologies. However, research in the ERP area is still
   lacking and the gap in the ERP literature is huge. Attempts to fill this
   gap by proposing a novel taxonomy for ERP research. Also presents the
   current status with some major themes of ERP research relating to ERP
   adoption, technical aspects of ERP and ERP in IS curricula. The
   discussion presented on these issues should be of value to researchers
   and practitioners. Future research work will continue to survey other
   major areas presented in the taxonomy framework.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, thousands of companies around the world have
   implemented enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Implementing an
   ERP system is generally a formidable challenge, with a typical ERP
   implementation taking anywhere from one to five years. The story of the
   success of ERP systems in achieving the stated objectives is mixed. Some
   companies have had very successful implementations while others have
   struggled. This paper empirically investigates and identifies key
   differences in the approaches used by companies that managed their
   implementations on-time and/or on/under-budget versus the ones that did
   not using data collected through a survey of US manufacturing companies
   that have implemented ERP systems. Logistic regressions are used to
   classify on-time and on/under-budget firm groups based on the survey
   responses and to identify the significant variables that contribute to
   on-time and on/ under-budget implementation performance. The results
   indicate that many different factors ranging from pre-implementation
   planning to system configuration influence performance, which managers
   should be sensitive about when implementing major systems like ERP. (C)

Abstract = {{ER-P 11 (ERP/2) systems is a new concept introduced by Gartner Group in
   2000 in order to label the latest extensions of the ERP-systems. The
   purpose of this paper is to explore the next-generation of ERP systems,
   the Extended Enterprise Resource Planning (EERP or as we prefer to use:
   eERP).
   The results of the paper are threefold: First a conceptual framework for
   eERP is established. Secondly, the business and research issues of this
   new framework are evaluated in the perspective of ERP and in particular
   the SCM developments. Third, the conceptual framework is applied in a
   discussion of potential impact on extended enterprise architecture..}},

Abstract = {{Implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is expensive
   and time consuming. A substantial cost is associated with
   pre-implementation involvement and training designed to encourage
   acceptance and effective implementation of the system. The results of
   this study indicate that, contrary to conventional wisdom, extensive
   organizational investments in shaping pre-implementation attitudes do
   not always achieve the desired effects. Despite extensive time, money
   and effort, length of time with the firm and position had a greater
   impact on attitudes toward ERP capabilities, value, acceptance and

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) has come to mean many things over the
   last several decades. Divergent applications by practitioners and
   academics, as well as by researchers in alternative fields of study, has
   allowed for considerable proliferation of information on the topic and
   for a considerable amount of confusion regarding the meaning of the
   term. In reviewing ERP research two distinct research streams emerge.
   The first focuses on the fundamental corporate capabilities driving ERP
   as a strategic concept. A second stream focuses on the details
   associated with implementing information systems and their relative
   success and cost. This paper briefly discusses these research streams
   and suggests some ideas for related future research. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have experienced a phenomenal
   growth in the last 5 years and at present they are pervasive in the US
   manufacturing sector. This paper describes an attempt to chronicle this
   phenomenon through a series of case studies and an extensive survey.
   Manufacturing companies ranging in size from a few million dollars in
   annual revenues to over a hundred billion dollars are included in this
   study. The key finding from this study is that companies of different
   sizes approach ERP implementations differently across a range of issues.
   Also, the benefits differ by company size. Larger companies report
   improvements in financial measures whereas smaller companies report
   better performance in manufacturing and logistics. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective of this paper is to present a procedure to evaluate a
   company's planning scenarios. At first, we will provide a procedure to
   improve the transparency of an enterprise-planning scenario. The
   procedure describes the material flow of a company and the information
   flow between different planning units. Both flows will be combined to
   estimate the strength of interdependency between planning units. For
   different scenarios, we will then derive an adequate coordination
   mechanism. Finally, we will provide a simulation model, which supports
   an enterprise to quantify the impact on the goal attainment of different
   coordination mechanisms, to find an adequate level of coordination.}},

Abstract = {{We present a generic reverse engineering process, aimed at developing a
   model that captures the available alternatives at different application
   levels of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Such a model is
   needed when ERP systems are aligned with the needs of the enterprise in
   which they are implemented. In order to support the ERP implementation
   process, the model should describe the entire scope of the ERP system's
   functionality and the alternative business processes it supports, as
   well as the interdependencies among them. We analyze the desired
   properties a modeling language should satisfy to be applied in
   constructing an ERP system model. This analysis, which follows the
   Cooperative Requirements Engineering With Scenarios classification
   framework in its adapted ERP modeling form, results in a set of criteria
   for evaluating modeling languages for this purpose. Using these
   criteria, we evaluate the Object-Process modeling Methodology and apply
   it for generating a detailed ERP system model. The generic process and
   detailed criteria we develop can serve for comprehensive ERP modeling,
   as well as for obtaining a model of other process-supportive
   off-the-shelf systems that are of generic and configurable nature. (C)

Abstract = {{Manufacturing has been identified as a key pillar of growth in many
   Southeast Asian (ASEAN) economies. However, in the last decade many
   countries have become keen competitors for foreign direct investments.
   Many countries are trying to improve their total business capabilities
   by encouraging computerisation of small and medium sized enterprises
   (SME). Manufacturing SMEs (MSMEs) are tasked to adopt technologically
   advanced programmes. With an improving public education system and more
   literate work force, more SMEs are better positioned to tap into the
   knowledge-based economy. There is tremendous amount of knowledge
   intensive activities within the multi-flows of the M-SMEs.
   Although the concept of ERP systems and artificial intelligence (AI)
   techniques have been around for more than two decades, this has largely
   remained the domain of the larger companies. ASEAN M-SMEs have been slow
   to implement it. In this paper, the various strategic and operational
   requirements of regional M-SMEs are presented and a knowledge-based
   resources planning model making use of At techniques is proposed. This
   improved AI model makes use of the large amount of accumulated knowledge
   typically found in the M-SMEs, especially those in the electronics and
   precision engineering sectors. This includes a case study of how an
   electronics precision engineering company adopted the proposed AI model.

Abstract = {{In this research, we evaluated user participation and involvement in the
   context of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Since ERP systems
   are enterprise-wide in scope, these systems have a high level of
   complexity, and require a different implementation methodology. While
   most studies analyze implementation at an organization or industry
   level, there is a dearth in research in ERP system adoption at the
   individual or user level. In our study, we examine ERP system acceptance
   at the individual level. In this research, we expected to find
   differences in the nature of user participation and involvement in ERP
   compared to other information systems. Using Barki and Hartwick's
   extension of the theory of reasoned action, a revised model was
   developed and tested empirically. While Barki and Hartwick's model
   explains user behavior vis-a-vis user participation and involvement, a
   more parsimonious model demonstrates that usage dynamics in ERP
   implementation are different. We complemented our statistical analysis
   by three case studies. Based on our results we believe that, given the
   nature of ERP and its implementation, traditionally formalized links
   between influencers of users' attitude and involvement may need to be
   revised. We have discussed why we need to seek alternate forms of
   influencers. In doing so, we suggest that investments be made in
   preparatory work practices and employee development prior to ERP
   decisions. Such investments are complementary to information technology
   and are widespread throughout the firm. We believe that such investments
   will play a significant role in influencing the attitude of users toward
   any system and also their involvement.}},

Abstract = {{At a time when many companies are embarking on enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) implementations, despite the belief among CEOs that
   approximately two-thirds of such systems are said to be failures, Texas
   Instruments' (TI) multi-stakeholder ER-P system offers many lessons for
   future adopters. A constancy of vision, providing visibility of the ERP
   system to external constituents via Web linkages, and standardization of
   internal processes and important information technology systems to
   support market needs, were the foundation for the success of this
   implementation. In this paper, we detail the management of this
   implementation from a process-oriented perspective. The lessons learned
   from this effort help to support and further the academic and
   practitioner literature especially in the area of large-scale
   information systems management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   to help integrate an organization's business operations and processes
   effectively and efficiently. Not ad firms have been successful in their
   ERP implementations and to that end research has helped to identify many
   factors that might be critical to a successful implementation. Such
   factors as the use of business process reengineering (BPR), and
   establishing a total quality management (TQM) culture have all shown to
   play important roles in ERP implementation. The focus of this survey
   research on US electronic manufacturing firms is to identify successful
   integration sequences of TQM and BPR with ERP The findings reveal that
   both the sequence of implementation and the strategies selected to
   initiate ERP systems can significantly impact business performance

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce a Resource Access Management (RAM) framework
   for resource utilities that facilitates Class of Service (CoS) based
   automated resource management. The framework may be used to offer
   resources on demand to enterprise applications that have time varying
   resource needs. The classes of service include guaranteed, predictable
   best effort, and best effort. The analytical apparatus we exploit
   requires the notion of application demand profiles that specify each
   application's resource requirements. These profiles may be statistical
   in nature. Consequently a policing mechanism is introduced to constrain
   each application's resource usage within its profile. A case study that
   exploits data from 48 data center servers, is used to demonstrate the
   framework. We show that our techniques are effective in: exploiting
   statistical multiplexing while providing service level assurances,
   limiting application demands in the presence of hostile application
   behaviour, and providing for differentiated service levels as planned.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes architecture of a simulation-supported Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP) system to provide engineers, managers, and
   business professionals with an interactive, dynamic, and enterprise-wide
   training and learning model. Such model aims at presenting key business
   functions in an organization in a consolidated and highly efficient and
   streamlined structure to be used for practicing enterprise modeling,
   analysis, and decision-making. Segmental training on standalone business
   functions will not provide trainee with a comprehensive and integral
   understanding of the coherency and synergy among different business
   function. Such vision is necessary to prepare successful business
   leaders and partners as an essential for prosperity in today's
   marketplace. Thus, and in addition to its critical operational
   functionality, ERP system can be utilized for enterprise-wide training
   and learning since it represents the practice consolidating of an
   enterprise's planning, manufacturing, and sales and marketing efforts
   into an integrated management and control system. As a core function in
   its business structure, an enterprise production system is often the
   primary driver of the performance of other business-supporting functions
   such as finance, sales, and distribution. The complexity and stochastic
   and dynamic nature of the enterprise production system, however, often
   limits the training and learning capability of an ERP system especially
   in understanding and practicing the actual dynamics of production
   activities and their interaction with other business functions.
   Therefore, a Simulation Module (SM), representing the underlying
   production system, is proposed as an interactive add-in module into a
   company's ERP system to compensate for such limitation towards better
   and more effective enterprise-wide training and learning. Training
   examples are presented to demonstrate the SM functionality into the ERP
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, worldwide enterprises have invested around \$300
   billion on Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementations {[}1]. An
   ERP system can provide accounting-oriented information services for
   handling customer orders. It normally requires a middleware layer to
   integrate with other back-end data sources and with the front-end
   applications such as web browsers. Developing the middleware from
   scratch tends to be a one-time solution that poses support
   discontinuation concern. On the other hand, commercial off-the-shelf
   Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) systems generally provide many
   packaged components that can shorten the middleware development cycle
   and ease subsequent maintenance efforts. In this paper, we present our
   experience in practicing one such EAI software, the IBM CrossWorlds, to
   integrate SAP, a leading ERP system in global market share, with the
   front-end web-based stores and operational databases.}},

Abstract = {{Most existing commercial packages, such as Product Data Management
   (PDM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Commerce at the Light
   Speed (CALS), are likely to have some problems; the cost of each package
   can be rather high and sometimes it can be hard to apply general
   packages to the specific tasks of companies. This paper presents a
   resource planning system (RPS) for small- and medium-sized companies
   that produce compound semiconductor wafers. The RPS adopts a concurrent
   paradigm to provide customers with credible delivery information in the
   ordering stage, as well as addresses lots of issues arising from a shop
   floor. The system is composed of five modules including Order
   Management, Production Scheduling, Work-in-process Management, Warehouse
   Management, and Product Inventory Management. These modules are
   implemented by web applications using Active Server Pages coded in
   Visual Basic Script. They are managed by an SQL database server on a
   Windows NT environment. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) was originated in the manufacturing
   industry. It provides a general working environment for an enterprise to
   integrate its major business management functions with one single common
   database so that information can be shared and efficient communications
   can be achieved between management functions. This paper first briefs
   the ERP technology, its origin, and its current development in general.
   Based on the needs of running a construction enterprise, ERP shows its
   potential for the construction industry. However, the unique nature of
   the industry prevents a direct implementation of existing ERP systems,
   which are primarily developed for the manufacturing industry. This paper
   underlines the importance of the establishment of the basic theory for
   developing construction enterprise resource planning systems (CERP). A
   CERP must address the nature of the general industry practice.
   Fundamental features are identified and discussed in the paper. A
   three-tiered client/server architecture is proposed, with discussions on
   the functions and major components of each tier. Needed research issues
   are discussed, including CERP architectures, project management
   functions, advanced planning techniques, standardization of management
   functions, and modeling human intelligence. Construction management
   examples are incorporated into the discussions.}},

   Several small exercises have been developed using the information
   contained in the database to illustrate business processes. The purpose
   of these exercises is to illustrate the capabilities of ERP systems
   similar to the use of spreadsheet and database software in the
   classroom. This paper describes the grant writing and award process and

Abstract = {{Product Data Management (PDM) systems and their offspring, Collaborative
   Product Development and Product Lifecycle Management technologies, aim
   to bring engineering enterprises together, allowing seamless
   interoperability between different departments and throughout the
   extended enterprises. However, there are a number of shortcomings in the
   current crop of commercially available systems, such as the lack of
   design knowledge sharing, links with Enterprise Resource Planning
   systems, knowledge management tools and a generic standard for PDM
   system implementation. This paper presents a proposed software solution
   to some of the above problems. In particular, the paper describes
   methodologies being developed that are aimed at overcoming the lack of
   analysable product information at the conceptual stage of product design
   and manufacturing evaluation, along with the integration of such a
   concept design tool within a distributed environment. A leading PDM
   system is used to manage all the information and knowledge that is made
   available to internet/intranet users in a controlled manner. The
   international standard for exchange of product data model ( STEP) is
   implemented to enable the integration of the design environment with
   manufacturing and enterprise resource management systems. In addition,
   the paper also introduces three other recent/ ongoing projects, being
   carried out at Cranfield University, in the application of PDM,
   knowledge management and STEP standard for integrated manufacturing

Abstract = {{Many prior researchers have criticized business planning, arguing that
   it interferes with the efforts of firm founders to undertake more
   valuable actions to develop their fledgling enterprises. In this paper,
   we challenge this negative view of business planning, arguing that
   business planning is an important precursor to action in new ventures.
   By helping firm founders to make decisions, to balance resource supply
   and demand, and to turn abstract goals into concrete operational steps,
   business planning reduces the likelihood of venture disbanding and
   accelerates product development and venture organizing activity.
   Empirically, we examine 223 new ventures initiated in the first 9 months
   of 1998 by a random sample of Swedish firm founders and provide support
   for our hypotheses. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{With the globalization of economic markets and the individuality of
   market demands, virtual enterprise is becoming an increasingly important
   organization since it can respond rapidly to market changes and make
   resource sharing more efficient among manufacturing partners. In this
   environment, potential partners may be dispersed geographically and
   possess different core competencies. Thus, how to select a set of
   plant-specific process plans capable of optimally responding to a given
   market opportunity has become a challenging research topic. This paper
   proposes a comprehensive cost function and establishes its mathematical
   formulation. The comprehensive cost function considers not only
   direct-processing cost, but also indirect-processing cost (
   transportation cost and time-factor cost including both earliness and
   tardiness). Based on the cost function, a pragmatic approach is
   presented for optimal plant - process combination selection in a virtual
   enterprise. This approach is composed of three stages: qualitative
   pre-qualification, quantitative evaluation and comprehensive
   examination. An example is implemented to illustrate these three stages.
   Compared with some traditional approaches in normal engineering
   activities, this approach could be expected to contribute more
   efficiently to reducing manufacturing cost, improving product quality,
   and shortening lead-time.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprises which are distributed in space and/or which are composed as
   a temporary joint venture of legally different units recently often
   called virtual (extended) enterprises. Planning, design and operation
   (management) goals and requirements of such firms are generally
   different from those of single, centralized enterprises. The basic
   feature of an extended (virtual) enterprise is that the co-operating
   units of it keep their independence during the life-cycle of the
   co-operation-what is well regulated by the rules of the given
   conglomerate. It has to be accepted-on the other hand-that several basic
   functionalities and goals are the same for all types of distributed,
   large, complex organizations, which are the targets of our recent study.
   The evolution of web-based manufacturing design/planning and operation
   system philosophies can be followed through the works presented in this
   paper. We intend to give software solutions for design, planning and
   operation (management) of complex, networked organizations represented
   as nodes of networks. In the first part of the paper, solutions are
   given to manage complex logistics flows of distributed SMEs, giving more
   sophisticated solutions than the commonly used supply-chain management
   (SCM) packages available in the market. The second problem we solve is a
   complex, web-based solution to manage large, expensive, multi-site,
   multi-company projects using any type of Enterprise Resource Planning
   (ERP) and flow management solutions. Our goal is to integrate as many
   available solutions as possible and to make only the appropriate
   frameworks including decision-support systems where necessary. The first
   part of the work means the establishment and application of a web server
   at each node of the co-operating network, while the second approach uses
   only one, joint web server and each node communicates with it through
   the network. These architectures are easy to be integrated if needed,
   i.e. logistic flows and project management can be solved together. (C)

Abstract = {{During the last decade, many companies have made large investments in
   the development and implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems. However, only few of these systems developed or installed have
   actually considered maintenance strategies. Maintenance is a complex
   process that is triggered by planned periodic repair (scheduled or
   planned maintenance), equipment breakdown or deterioration indicated by
   a monitored parameter (unplanned or emergency maintenance). This process
   requires planning, scheduling, monitoring, quality assurance and
   deployment of necessary resources (workshop, manpower, machines,
   equipment, tools, spare parts, materials). Proper design and integration
   of maintenance management into ERP systems enable enterprises to
   effectively manage their production planning an scheduling, as well as
   to analyze their maintenance history so as to carry out cost analysis
   and produce future projections of failure trends. The present work
   presents the design of an object-oriented maintenance management model
   and its integration into an ERP system.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning systems, if implemented successfully, can
   bestow impressive strategic, operational and information-related
   benefits to adopting firms. A failed implementation can often spell
   financial doom. Currently, most of the information about the failures
   and successes are based on reports on implementations in large
   manufacturing and service organizations. But enterprise resource
   planning vendors are now steadily turning their marketing sights on
   small and medium-sized manufacturers. The time is ripe for researchers
   to gather, analyze and disseminate information that will help these
   firms to implement their projects successfully. This research adopts a
   multiple case study approach to investigate the implementation process
   in small and midsize manufacturing firms in the US. The research focuses
   on implementation activities that foster successful installations and
   are developed using information gleaned from our field studies of four
   projects. Avenues for future research are also suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
   software acquisition process that reflects the findings from the four
   cases examined in this study. This ERP acquisition process model
   includes six distinctive, yet interrelated, processes (planning,
   information search, selection, evaluation, choice, and negotiations).
   This paper depicts the principal processes and many of the constituent
   activities, issues, dynamics, and complexities that pertain to the
   acquisition of ERP software. The results from this study contribute to
   the identification of processes that are part of this type of
   acquisition. Further, this model also suggests complexities that are
   worthy of further investigation, in and of themselves, if for no other
   reason than that they could prove the limit of generalizability of the
   model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As the backbone of e-business, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system
   plays an important role in today's competitive business environment. Few
   publications discuss the application of ERP systems in a virtual

   enterprises that can bring together complementary core competencies
   needed to achieve a business task. Since VE strongly emphasises partner
   cooperation, specific issues exist relative to the implementation of ERP
   systems in a VE.
   This paper discusses the use of VE Performance Measurement System
   (VEPMS) to coordinate ERP systems of VE partners. It also defines the
   framework of a `Virtual Enterprise Resource Planning (VERP) system', and
   identifies research avenues in this field.}},

Title = {{The impact of ERP on supply chain management: Exploratory findings from
   a European Delphi study}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{146}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{284-301}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{This article presents results from a Delphi study on the future impact
   of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems on supply chain management
   (SCM). The Delphi study was conducted with 23 Dutch supply chain
   executives of European multi-nationals. Findings from this exploratory
   study were threefold. First, our executives have identified the
   following key SCM issues for the coming years: (1) further integration
   of activities between suppliers and customers across the entire supply
   chain; (2) on-going changes in supply chain needs and required
   flexibility from IT; (3) more mass customization of products and
   services leading to increasing assortments while decreasing cycle times
   and inventories; (4) the locus of the driver's seat of the entire supply
   chain and (5) supply chains consisting of several independent
   enterprises.
   The second main finding is that the panel experts saw only a modest role
   for ERP in improving future supply chain effectiveness and a clear risk
   of ERP actually limiting progress in SCM. ERP was seen as offering a
   positive contribution to only four of the top 12 future supply chain
   issues: (1) more customization of products and services; (2) more
   standardized. processes and information; (3) the need for worldwide IT
   systems; and (4) greater transparency of the marketplace. Implications
   for subsequent research and management practice are discussed.
   The following key limitations of current ERP systems in providing
   effective SCM support emerge as the third finding from this exploratory
   study: (1) their insufficient extended enterprise functionality in
   crossing organizational boundaries; (2) their inflexibility to
   ever-changing supply chain needs, (3) their lack of functionality beyond
   managing transactions, and (4) their closed and non-modular system
   architecture. These limitations stem from the fact that the first
   generation of ERP products has been designed to integrate the various
   operations of an individual firm. In modern SCM; however, the unit of
   analysis has become a network of organizations, rendering these ERP
   products inadequate in the new economy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The explosion of the Internet has affected many facets of work style in
   the manufacturing industry; yet all indications are that the revolution
   is still in its infancy. Manufacturing enterprises need to reshape their
   working model in order to sustain a competitive edge in this global
   manufacturing era. An Internet-enabled enterprise resource planning
   (ERP) is crucial to the continuous development of a manufacturing
   enterprise. Accordingly, in this paper, the authors propose an
   implementation model called Web-based Object-Oriented Model (WOOM) to
   implement an ERP system under a global perspective, which provides the
   framework, channel and the interface necessary to build a Web-based ERP
   system in a global business environment. The proposed model aims to
   provide a basis for the manufacturers to implement ERP in a systematic
   manner. By using advanced development techniques, a sophisticated, yet
   easy to use, building model that provides a total solution for all areas
   of a global ERP system has been implemented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel taxonomy of the critical success factors in
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation process. ERP benefits
   cannot be fully realised unless a strong alignment and reconciliation
   mechanism is established between technical and organisational
   imperatives based on the principles of process orientation. It is
   suggested in the taxonomy that measurement takes place in a balanced
   perspective, and for the purpose of providing useful information that
   can enable the decision making process and, which can help deliver the
   corporate objectives and therefore lead the business competitively
   forward. Upon this premise, the taxonomy is based on a comprehensive
   analysis of ERP literature combining research studies and organisational
   experiences. The taxonomy reflects the essential features of ERP
   systems, as being built based on the principles of business process
   management. Furthermore, it illustrates that ERP benefits are realised
   when a tight link is established between implementation approach and
   business process performance measures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{For many businesses the common administration of projects in addition to
   their daily business constitutes a great challenge - a major obstacle
   seems to be that conventional project management tools and languages do
   not aim at an integration with standard ERP systems or frequently used
   business planning languages. This article presents Project-MEMO, a new
   modeling approach for an integrated planning, implementation and
   controlling of projects in businesses. The foundation of Project-MEMO is
   the augmentation of process description languages to enable an
   integrated modeling of projects. Project-MEMO unites languages to
   compile a multi-perspective image of a company - such as processes, the
   organizational structure of business units and projects, business goals,
   as well as resources. This article's aim is the presentation of the
   Project-MEMO kernel: languages describing the dynamic and static
   structure, and the unifying language architecture. On top of the
   integrated administration of projects with standard enterprise planning,
   this article explores additional benefits derived for Multi-Project
   Management and Knowledge Management.}},

Abstract = {{The recent privatization of state-owned enterprises in the Czech
   Republic forms a natural experiment to test and compare the predictive
   ability of the resource-based view (RBV) against the market-based view
   (MBV) under conditions of great change. It has been recognized in the
   literature that, under normal stable circumstances, a firm's internal
   resources and its external market power are fundamentally intertwined.
   Consequently, it is difficult to identify the relative roles of these
   two theories in explaining expected firm performance and firm value.
   However, when market conditions are in a state of flux, as in the case
   of the Czech Republic in 1992, we expect the firm's resources to be the
   primary determinants of firm value. In order to test this notion, an RBV
   model was developed, based on a set of firm features reflecting the rare
   and valuable ability to compete in the emerging capitalistic economy (as
   opposed to the currently prevailing bureaucratically planned economy). A
   contrasting MBV model was also developed, highlighting the role of
   market power in this regard. These models were assessed in a
   crosssectional sample of 988 Czech firms undergoing privatization. The
   empirical findings show that the RBV-driven variables are remarkably
   better at explaining share values of Czech firms in the period of
   privatization than MBV-driven variables. These results underscore the
   role of firm resources as a primary determinant of firm value in rapidly
   changing environments. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at the Integration Strategy problematic in order to
   answer the current market expectations and foresee their evolutions. It
   is a question of providing flexible and modular solutions making it
   possible to integrate the production services into the Manufacturing
   Execution system. So that the companies can carry out their operations
   with the effectiveness, quality and maximum performance and improve
   consequently their productivity, their reliability and their
   profitability. By defining the MES concept (Manufacturing Execution
   System), ERP (Resource Planning Enterprise) and the control System
   (CONTROLS). The information system is considered according to MES and
   CONTROLS point of view.
   Our model searches to integrate the MES Concept in the Information
   System specially the ERP. This integration aims at exploiting the
   pertinent information developed by the Manufacturing Execution System.
   By using UML and XMI, we propose a definition methodology, and an
   exchange of technical data information.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid development in information technology has transformed not only
   the way people work and interact with each other, but also the focus of
   management, from within the enterprise to the relations among business
   partners. Electronic media, such as e-mail, LAN, intranet and Internet,
   enable tools that help the enterprise to collaborate on its work and
   missions within its own organization and with other independent
   enterprises, including suppliers, customers and even competitors. The
   work activities that are related to these electronic media are defined
   as e-Work. This article addresses the emerging and future problems of
   ERP systems in both the development and implementation perspectives. The
   characteristics of the next generation of ERP systems are presented
   based on conclusions from several of Purdue University's PRISM Center
   research projects in planning distributed information and production

Abstract = {{This study proposes to identify critical success factors in Enterprise
   Resource Planning Systems implementation. ERP systems promise to provide
   an off-the-shelf solution to the information needs of organizations.
   Despite this promise, implementation projects are plagued with much
   publicized failures and abandoned projects. These software products
   require most organizations to change existing business processes to
   adopt the standardized process provided by the ERP systems. As economic
   resources and management time are scarce in most organizations, the
   results of this study should aid management in controlling those factors
   that are most important to project success.
   The current study utilizes a framework developed by Sneller (1986) in
   the study of critical success factors in MRP implementation. Various
   proposed CSFs will be subjected to a factor study to identify variables
   relevant to ERP outcomes.}},

   attributes from the core product, process and resource digital models to
   create an initial valid plan and a dynamic `manufacturing phase space'.
   Within this phase space, the detailed methods, heuristics and algorithms
   are deployed in order to optimize the initial plan by evaluating
   alternative processes and resources. The evaluation is based on an
   alternative's impact on the overall solution obtained by applying
   user-defined cardinal weightings on quality, cost, delivery and
   knowledge (QCD + K) metrics. To enable the application of business
   objectives on QCD + K, methods were developed for the conversion of
   quality, delivery and knowledge into a cost equivalent. The paper is
   concluded with an example based upon the collaborating company's
   aerospace products.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise Engineering and Integration, especially in the new
   environments of extended and virtual enterprises can be very efficiently
   supported by business process modelling (BPM). BPM can enable simulation
   of what-if scenarios, provide enhanced decision support based on real
   time operation monitoring, and can be employed for the control of
   enterprise assets. It may serve to prepare user requirements and to
   design of integrated information systems, like ERP (Enterprise Resource
   Planning). However, with many dissimilar modelling methodologies
   available, the selection of the most suited one becomes a very difficult
   task. Most modelling methodologies follow the life-cycle concept, but
   usually cover only the early phases, namely requirements definition and
   design specification. In addition, diverging terminology and different
   modelling language constructs used for the representation of the model
   are further obstacles to selecting most appropriate model based
   solution.
   Starting from the CIMOSA architecture, the paper investigates and
   compares modelling constructs of selected, BPM methodologies, using the
   draft standard ``Constructs for Enterprise Modelling{''} (EN ISO 19440,
   2002) as a reference. Further, examples of user oriented construct types
   and an overview of icon types for graphical representation are
   presented. User requirements for improved BPM methodologies, construct
   types and tool interfaces are derived and discussed which will help to
   improve common understanding, acceptance and deployment of the
   technologies. The paper will serve to harmonise future user requirements
   and case the design of interfaces between modelling tools, as outlined
   in the UEML project. Finally, the impact and benefits of standards in
   this context are briefly discussed. Only with increased efforts in
   harmonisation and standardisation, will the envisaged potential
   improvements of business process modelling be realised.}},
