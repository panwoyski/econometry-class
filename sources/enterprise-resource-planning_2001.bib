Abstract = {{The common evaluation method and its limitation for enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) implementation performance are described in this paper.
   With the increasing demand for ERP applications, effective evaluation
   methods are becoming critically important and impending. As a result, a
   new evaluation method-balanced scorecard (BSC) is introduced, together
   with the key performance indicator and the principle of BSC, a framework
   of BSC method for ERP evaluation is established in this paper. At last,
   the future work of BSC for ERP performance evaluation is pointed out in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{An enterprise resource planning system (ERP) is the information backbone
   of many manufacturing companies. At the core of ERP is a conventional
   material requirements planning (MRP) production planning system or a
   variation of MRP when just-in-time (JIT) principles are used in
   manufacturing. MRP and JIT both organize production planning into a
   hierarchy of long-, medium- and short-range problems. In all there are
   eight different problems. Some are common to MRP and JIT, others are
   specialized for a particular system. This paper analyses the
   computational requirements of these problems. This is important for ERP
   because it plans for large numbers of products (e.g. 50 000 products at
   3M Company and 44 000 products at States Industries in Oregon) at large
   numbers of locations (e.g. 82 locations in 21 countries for Visteon
   Automotive Systems of Michigan and 19 locations at Boeing). We show that
   adequate algorithms exist for some problems, but better algorithms are
   needed for other problems if ERP is to provide useful production plans.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software is a dominant approach for
   dealing with legacy information system problems. In order to avoid
   invalidating maintenance and development support from the ERP vendor,
   most organizations reengineer their business processes in line with
   those implicit within the software. Regardless, some customization is
   typically required. This paper presents two case studies of ERP projects
   where customizations have been performed. The case analysis suggests
   that while customizations can give true organizational benefits, careful
   consideration is required to determine whether a customization is viable
   given its potential impact upon future maintenance. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A multiple case study approach was employed to identify maintenance
   activities pertaining to enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   implementation, classify them into maintenance categories, and assess
   their relative frequency at various stages of the ERP maintenance
   lifecycle. Five maintenance categories (corrective, adaptive,
   perfective, preventive, user support) were identified from a review of
   the literature on software maintenance. A new category pertaining to
   `communication, coordination and knowledge exchange with external
   parties' and herein labeled `external parties' is introduced to
   highlight the supporting role of external parties in ERP maintenance.
   This category includes reporting problems to vendors and consultants,
   tracking their progress towards problem resolution, and coordinating
   work and relations with vendors, consultants, and external
   user-organizations. This study also highlights some differences between
   maintenance trends of ERP versus traditional systems. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{In this presentation, a new approach for a flexible low-cost Internet
   extended enterprise (project FLoCI-EE) will be presented. FLoCI-EE is a
   project in the fifth framework programme of the European commission with
   8 partners from 4 countries, which started in January 2001 and will be
   finished in December 2003. The main objective of FLoCI-EE is the
   development of a software prototype, which enables flexible enterprise
   cooperation with the aim to design, manufacture and sell products
   commonly, independent of enterprise borderlines.
   The needed IT-support includes functions of product data management
   (PDM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management (SCM)
   and customer relationship management (CRM). Especially for small and
   medium sized enterprises, existing solutions are too expensive and
   inflexible to be of use under current turbulent market conditions.
   The second part of this paper covers the item Web Services, because in
   the role-specific support approach of FLoCI-EE, there are
   user-interface-components, which are tailored for specific roles in an
   enterprise. These components integrate automatically the services of the
   so-called basic-components, and the externally offered Web Services like
   UDDI.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1997 the authors have prototyped an enterprise resource management
   (ERM) system recommending essential improvements to the available
   software packages, which today claim automatic real time performance and
   an efficient transaction-oriented approach. The ERM system proposed is a
   decision-making tool for the manufacturing industry, which makes
   integrated financial/production trade-off planning and optimisation in
   the supply chain management. The application supports management cycles
   because during its use are available degrees of freedom to make the
   system work as a decision-making tool. The enterprises must be aware of
   its internal problems to be dynamically approachable instead of
   prematurely evolving to networked enterprises by links in the electronic
   commerce. ERM systems are capable of managing dynamically realistic and
   optimal delivery dates with price-time trade-off during the marketing
   activities. Cost objective functions integrated with system performance
   measures are developed, including a cost model to evaluate the due date
   policy economics in real time. The order management sq stem proposed is
   based on the TicTacToe algorithm, which follows an exact
   non-combinatorial deterministic approach to time and optimise production
   sequences in multiproduct plants in very short time using asymmetric
   travelling salesman problem formulations for the scheduling task. The
   resulting tool is appropriate to fulfil the requirements of autonomous
   order entry systems in integrated real time systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There's no doubt that companies of all types and sizes, particularly in
   manufacturing sectors, are trying their best to survive the competition
   of the market. Thus many advanced technologies and tools are being
   applied, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and BPR (Business
   Process Reengineering) so as to strengthen the competitive advantage.
   This paper suggests that enterprises applying ERP should reengineer its
   business process in order to succeed. The ERP, however, cannot get the
   expected target without the success of BPR. The reasons have been
   analyzed in lots of studies. The paper explores that human resource is
   the major attributes in applying ERP and BPR that can help enterprise
   reconsider its human resource in applying ERP and BPR to ensure the
   success of the company.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretically and ideally, enterprise resource planning (ERP) seeks to
   streamline and integrate operation processes and information flow within
   a company. Practically, ERP system implementation involves a much
   broader scope and in-depth consideration within an organization as a
   whole. Concurrently, in response to this need for resource optimization,
   the impact of globalization has caused the emergence of a new business
   operation format, global logistics management (GLM). This pertains to
   the overall management system of a corporation's undertaking of
   worldwide market distribution, product design, customer satisfaction,
   production, procurement, logistics, suppliers and inventory. Suggests
   building an ERP as the backbone for implementation of a GLM system,
   while minimizing the impact of changes by use of information system
   reengineering technology (ISRT). Proposes a novel development framework
   that applies ISRT and ERP to developing a GLM system to economize on the
   system implementation cost and minimize the impact of changes within the
   corporation as a whole.}},

   The main conclusion is that Chinese SOEs are very keen to implement AMT
   and replace their outdated equipment. However, owing to the lack of
   financial resources and experience, the percentage of AMT in SOEs is
   still very low. Those AMT methods adopted range mainly between
   stand-alone systems and islands of automation. AMTs are adopted in the
   areas of planning and controlling, information management, design and
   engineering, fabrication, and assembly. Implications for practice and/or
   future research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The intricate nature of scheduling at a printing company is described.
   Many of its subtle operational complexities and sophisticated work order
   selection rules are explained in depth to emphasize the highly refined
   nature of a strongly sequence-dependent process. A simulation-based
   scheduling tool integrated with an enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   system is used to capture the required level of process detail. The
   results are comprehensive schedules that reflect the collective needs of
   the entire production process, improved understanding of
   interdepartmental effects, increased productivity, better visibility of
   future production requirements, and faster schedule turn around times.

Abstract = {{Enterprises face mounting pressures to reduce costs and to better use
   existing staff or equipment. At least in part, these pressures can be
   met by more efficient and intelligent planning; methods for this task
   lie at the heart of management science and operations research.
   Successful application of such methods depends on unambiguous model
   formulations. They, in turn, call for expressive modeling concepts that
   allow one to capture a wide range of requirements appearing in
   real-world problems. Throughout the last decade, one particularly
   successful modeling concept in this regard has been the one of scarce
   resources. We generalize the classical resource concepts of nonrenewable
   and renewable resources to partially renewable ones. In addition to a
   very general class of resource limitations, partially renewable
   resources allow one to formulate a variety of logical relations between
   scheduling decisions. This paper demonstrates different ways to make use
   of these capabilities, in terms of model formulations as well as of
   practical applications. (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The integrity of the data used to operate and make decisions about a
   business affects the relative efficiency of operations and quality of
   decisions made. Protecting that integrity can be difficult and becomes
   more difficult as the size and complexity of the business and its
   systems increase. Recovering data integrity may be impossible once it is
   compromised. Stewards of transactional and planning systems must
   therefore employ a combination of procedures including systematic
   safeguards and user-training programs to counteract and prevent dirty
   data in those systems. Users of transactional and planning systems must
   understand the origins and effects of dirty data and the importance of
   and means of guarding against it. This requires a shared understanding
   within the context of the business of the meaning, uses, and value of
   data across functional entities. In this paper, we discuss issues
   related to the origin of dirty data, associated problems and costs of
   using dirty data in an organization. the process of dealing with dirty
   data in a migration to a new system: enterprise resource planning (ERP),
   and the benefits of an ERP in managing dirty data. These issues are
   explored in the paper using a case study.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers are beginning to develop taxonomies of different knowledge
   domains in order to specify the requirements of engineering functions in
   various manufacturing enterprises. These interrelated functions include
   product design, process planning, capacity planning, production costing,
   quality control, acquisition or reconfiguration of resources, planning
   and scheduling of shop activities, and execution of shop activities.
   These taxonomies and functions are not typically integrated in today's
   manufacturing enterprise. This results in inefficient manual transfer of
   knowledge between domains and the unavailability of critical information
   required for decision making. Object-oriented design methodologies are
   useful for modeling diverse information and behavior. Furthermore,
   planning, analysis, and control of resources such as machine tools,
   fixtures, and tooling increasingly dominate the engineering functions.
   This paper demonstrates how to integrate these functions with an
   object-oriented resource model that links information from different
   knowledge domains. These functions are implemented using different
   software packages that can easily access the common resource data
   because the data are embedded in the resource class structure. This
   resource model is based on software objects that have a one-to-one
   correspondence with physical objects. This resource model is illustrated
   using object-oriented software, but the model may also be applied to
   distributed object and agent architectures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an interpretation of information technology
   implementation in a relatively unexplored context, that of higher
   education. In recent years, there has been a call by governments across
   the world for universities to improve operational efficiency and to
   reduce duplication of resources by implementing advanced information
   systems that span the institution and improve processes. Universities in
   response turned their efforts to implementing complex ERP systems to
   facilitate the essential cross-functional information integration, free
   internal information flows, and improve the provision and quality of
   management information. This paper investigates in turn whether
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems present a feasible
   information system strategy for higher education institutions. Four
   in-depth case studies were conducted in higher education institutions
   (HEIs) that were in the process of implementing ERP systems. Numerous
   complexities, especially in terms of power, politics, and resistance
   arose in light of the structure of the HEIs.}},

Abstract = {{The development of new generations of information systems, known as
   Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, generated a gap between the
   knowledge that managers need to use these systems efficiently and
   effectively, and the curriculum of most traditional academic programs.
   This gap is due to the difference between the integrated approach of ERP
   systems, which supports complete processes, and the approach of most
   Industrial Engineering and management courses, which focus on specific
   functions such as Marketing, Operations, Finance or Purchasing. This
   paper presents a new framework for teaching and training in the ERP era.
   A methodology for teaching processes is presented along with a special
   training tool that combines an interactive, dynamic case study and an
   educational version of an ERP- like Management Information System. The
   tool and the methodology form a framework for teaching individuals and
   teams. The framework is designed to facilitate individual learning and
   to provide an environment that enhances and supports teamwork in
   managing the order fulfilment process. The experience accumulated with
   the methodology and its supporting training tool over the last three
   years reveal that it is very effective in teaching the concepts of ERP,
   workflow and team decision making. The proposed framework was used in
   Universities in Business schools and in Industrial Engineering programs.
   It was also used in workshops in industry, training managers interested
   in ERP and its implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Current advances in information technology and, in particular
   computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and
   enterprise resources planning (ERP) system, have led organisations to
   undertake significant investments in these systems. Next generation
   manufacturers require both systems to maintain or gain a competitive
   advantage, reduce risks and improve productivity and viability. In
   addition recent attention to the implementation of CAD/CAM system
   highlights their important role in automating complex design and next
   generation manufacturing processes. In the next millennium more
   manufacturers are likely to implement CAD/CAM and ERP systems and hence
   issues in the integration of CAD/CAM with ERP systems must become a
   major concern. Accordingly, this paper will: explore the problems of
   integration of CAD/CAM systems with ERP systems,. study how the severity
   of these problems relates to CAD/CAM integration success; propose a set
   of critical success factors (CSF) for the integration of CAD/CAM with
   ERP systems; suggest hypotheses to study the relevance of these CSF for
   successful integration of CAD/CAM with ERP systems. In addition, the
   paper also demonstrates the importance of successful integration of
   CAD/CAM systems with other applications for next generation
   manufacturers. These findings suggest that integration of CAD/CAM
   systems with ERP systems is complex involving many factors.}},

   functionalities within the organizations. Further, within the context of
   ``managing the supply chain{''}, ERP systems promise to include even
   more coverage, in essence automating the entire Chain. This is achieved
   through all encompassing software. Over the last four years, success
   stories of ERP implementations have been few and far in between. Besides
   high initial start-up costs and high implementation costs, the
   implementation process have been problematic due to lack of due
   consideration to the `human' component. Consequently, many companies
   have minimized their losses by abandoning their projects mid-course.
   This paper takes the perspective that ERP is in desperate need of
   ergonomic research, design and implementation to minimize the financial
   and human costs currently being experienced.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we consider the value of shared information within a
   business network. To make the problem concrete, we focus on a specific
   operational problem: How the final supplier to the customer determines
   promised delivery dates. In a traditional supply chain, the final
   supplier has little or no information on the delivery performance of
   intermediate suppliers and thus, has limited information with which to
   set delivery dates. On the other hand, in an information-integrated
   business network, the final supplier's enterprise resource planning
   (ERP) system can interact with all the intermediate supphers' ERP
   systems to determine exactly how far ahead or behind schedule the
   network is in meeting the needs of a specific customer. This information
   should improve the final supplier's ability to set realistic delivery
   dates. We attempt to quantify the value of this information and
   determine precisely why it is valuable so that management can best
   exploit information integration.
   We use a modeling approach in this research, beginning with simple
   analytic models and progressing to more realistic simulation models. Our
   analytic model establishes an important principle: Information
   integration not only significantly improves the average on-time delivery
   performance of a business network, but also dramatically improves its
   worst-case performance. Because customer dissatisfaction is generally
   associated with worst-case performance, information integration may be
   highly beneficial even if its effect on average on-time delivery is
   small. Simulation models allow us to compare the performance of more
   realistic business networks. These models suggest, for example, that the
   value of information integration is dependent on both the structure of
   the network itself (whether serial or arborescent) and on the typical
   customer order date in the production cycle. These insights allow us to
   begin to identify the types of business networks in which information
   integration will have the highest value.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) technologies can, despite their
   apparent flexibility, act as a rather obdurate tool for management's
   political programmes. To understand this, a combined organisational
   politics and sociology of technology approach is adopted, viewing
   technology as a political Programme for change. A total of 30
   manufacturing case studies grouped around three ERP vendors and systems,
   show that using technology is not only an issue controlled by an
   enterprise's actors. IT suppliers and management consultants and others
   form communities, which promote certain political programmes. These
   cases demonstrate that enterprise configurations of ERP do share
   commonalities, whereas two longitudinal case studies are used to discuss
   unique enterprise politics. While some features of the systems/political
   programmes were frozen, others were fluid, and could be configured in
   micro political processes. Thus hardness is contextual. The political
   role of technology is not just a case of flexibility or hardness, but a
   complicated pattern of negotiability, resources, social and geographical
   distance.}},

Abstract = {{Extended factories consisting of geographically dispersed independent
   production facilities are already a reality in the global economy.
   Production facilities concentrate on core technologies and create
   partner networks for the manufacturing of their products, a trend
   initially visible in semiconductor manufacturing but quickly spreading
   to other industries. A methodology, more flexible and efficient than the
   traditional time-bucket-based techniques and dynamic dispatching
   heuristics, to plan the Extended Semiconductor Enterprise and schedule
   work at the different production entities is presented in this paper.
   The generic approach also opens opportunities for applications in other
   discrete manufacturing industries. The methodology uses stepwise search
   procedures to improve plans and make-or-buy decision processes to solve
   resource constraints. Focus of the paper is principally on resource
   scheduling and less on logistics and distribution topics. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{How a firm supports its enterprise resource planning system after
   putting it into production, when its maintenance may be said to be
   emergent, is critical to the benefits it will eventually derive. Here we
   report a longitudinal case study of one firm's emergent maintenance of
   its SAP R/3 system. The study reveals that maintenance-related roles and
   relationships differ substantively from those typical of traditional
   maintenance. We view this firm's maintenance practices to be a harbinger
   of broader and longer-term change in maintaining application portfolios.
   We suggest that the roles and relationships involved are likely to be
   more complex and therefore more varied in organizational form. In
   particular, we anticipate: (1) greater sharing of the maintenance task
   among more participants, with the firm's users often assuming the lead,
   supported by vendors and third parties; (2) the IS department often
   playing a more limited, but still key role in providing a portfolio's
   ongoing support services; and (3) a contingency approach to maintenance,
   the best approach being a function of specific organizational and
   systems circumstances. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper identifies the challenges encountered in the Integration of
   Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Cost Estimating (CE) systems.
   Customers of ERP vendors traditionally implement the financial modules
   first, and so, there is a dramatic shift by ERP vendors to include CE
   functions to their systems to accelerate attaining meaningful results
   from their software. But when it comes to develop cost estimates at the
   early stage of product development cycle, ERP software has little to
   offer. The research reported in the paper is based on literature review
   and an industry survey. A semi-structured questionnaire is used to
   capture the experience of people in industry trying to integrate ERP and

Abstract = {{One of the challenges faced by an enterprise with employees in multiple
   locations is to design a high performance, secure and interoperable
   distributed computing system (DCS) to interconnect all locations and
   operations. The problem is computationally hard; hence, subcomponents of
   it have been studied in detail. These tend to be complex, predominantly
   theoretical, and somewhat limited from a practical standpoint in terms
   of providing an integrated solution. Researchers have indicated the need
   to study the integrated DCS design problem. We merge the complex
   components and demonstrate that this intrinsically hard problem can be
   modeled using a component-wise iterative approach. We present a
   methodology for resource planning and integration that is simple and
   practical, and can be applied to real-life problems. The methodology
   includes performance, cost, security and interoperability issues as DCS
   design objectives. It distributes data and application systems across
   multiple locations, and aids in security and interoperability
   configuration, such that the overall design objectives are satisfied.
   This is one of the first attempts at combining the various components of
   DCS design and applying it to a real-life problem. The design framework
   has been successfully used to design a distributed training system for a
   large, geographically dispersed organization.}},

Abstract = {{One of the critical processes of an organizations supply chain is the
   return material process. Ineffective management of this process can
   result in financial loss, poor customer service and negative quality
   impacts. However, often this process is given little, if any, attention
   even though the financial and operational impacts of a poorly designed
   and managed returned material process are significant. Because this
   process crosses several functional areas (materials, accounting,
   manufacturing, sales, and service), an integrated information system
   solution is required. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems provide
   a potential solution. This paper will focus on the design of a return
   material authorization (RMA) process and the ERP information system
   solution required in supporting this process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Strategic alliances are increasingly gaining favour over go-it-alone
   strategies for organisations to achieve fast and economical growth. This
   study aims to identify critical success factors in alliance-making with
   special consideration given to the specific situation of small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A comprehensive questionnaire was used
   to interview a random sample of key executives in 164 Austrian SMEs.
   This paper reports on the results of that empirical survey, and seeks to
   identify the weights of various success factors in alliance-making in
   SMEs. The results show that ``soft{''} facts such as trust are important
   for alliance success, but not on their own sufficient. Also ``hard{''}
   facts such as strategic compatibility and appropriate governance
   mechanisms have an important influence on alliance success. Careful
   strategic planning and good partnership preparation are essential for
   alliance success, but the full value of an alliance has to be developed
   as it evolves. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, many large organizations have been shifting from
   developing their own information system (IS) to licensing and installing
   large software packages known as enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems. These organizations now face the challenge of maintaining these
   costly systems and many are about to make their first upgrade decisions.
   The study reported herein aims to address the following research
   questions from the ERP-client perspective: (1) What are the fundamental
   factors driving ERP maintenance and upgrade decisions? (2) How do these
   factors differ from those for traditional custom, in-house software? and
   (3) Do existing software and hardware replacement models suffice for ERP
   maintenance and upgrade decision modeling? A single case study method
   and empirical data analysis were conducted and are presented here. We
   observe that ERP maintenance and upgrade characteristics are indeed
   unique in three ways: (1) most organizations maintain and upgrade their
   ERP systems in order to realize increased business benefits from the
   systems; (2) a new version upgrade reduces the number of ERP-client-done
   enhancement modifications; and (3) a new version upgrade potentially
   reduces future legal change patch (LCP) maintenance distributed by the
   ERP vendor. It was also found that on average LCP maintenance is almost
   as costly as user enhancements. Based on these findings, we conclude
   that the existing in-house software and hardware replacement models are
   insufficient for ERP situations. We propose a preliminary ER-P decision
   model that overcomes the observed insufficiencies. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) packages provide generic
   off-the-shelf business and software solutions to customers. However,
   these packages are implemented in companies with different
   organisational and national cultures, and there is growing evidence that
   failure to adapt ERP packages to fit these cultures leads to projects
   that are expensive and late. This paper describes research that
   synthesises social science theories of culture to handle the impact of
   culture on ERP package implementation more efficiently. It describes a
   knowledge meta-schema for modelling the surface and the deeper
   manifestations of culture. It reports an empirical study into the
   implementation of SAP R/3's sales and distribution (SD) module in a
   large pharmaceuticals organisation in Scandinavia and the UK. Results
   provide evidence for an association between organisational culture and
   ERP implementation problems but no direct evidence for an association
   between national culture and implementation problems. Furthermore,
   results demonstrate that these diverse implementation problems can be
   caused by a mismatch between a small set of core values indicative of a
   customer's organisational culture. At the end of the paper, our
   predictions are reviewed, conclusions are made about them and about the
   work of the key authors of national and organisational culture, and
   future work is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Information generation, representation and control in a manufacturing
   enterprise are often done through interactions of a variety of
   application software. Application software such as resource planning,
   electronic design automation, computer aided design and manufacturing,
   product data management, various database and supply-chain management
   applications are essential for an enterprise to be successful in this
   information age. For an enterprise to operate effectively, individual
   application must communicate and interact with each other, and user
   groups can share and exchange pools of information. Although
   client/server technology can break some of the barriers, with
   applications being shared among common databases and open system
   platforms, it does not imply that the applications are capable of
   inter-operating data and document can be efficiently managed and
   distributed over the manufacturing enterprise at large. XML provides a
   tool to integrate data from different sources and eliminate
   client-extensions to achieve universal access. In this paper, we will
   incorporate XML in a manufacturing enterprise to provide a
   cross-organizational support for a board range of users, across hardware
   and software boundaries conveniently and cost effectively.}},

Abstract = {{An approach extending design for manufacturability (DFM) by the
   exploitation of key technologies is presented. Computer automated
   process planning (CAPP) technology, designed for the estimation of
   quality, cost and delivery (QCD) values from the earliest stages of
   design, will be integrated into commercial CAD software. This
   manufacturing planner generates a nearly optimal plan with respect to
   product, process and manufacturing resource models, and according to the
   specified QCD weightings. An enterprise data management (EDM) system
   provides enterprise models to the planner, so that design decisions at
   all times reflect manufacturability. Verification of plans is done in a
   3D simulation package, so that risks can be reduced. Tolerance analysis
   and measurement of key features also contribute to the refinement of
   manufacturing plans.}},

Abstract = {{Business process innovation capability is a source for sustainable
   competitiveness. Business process innovations create value added in the
   enterprise, and can trigger strategic renewal. The management of
   business process innovation requires empowering mechanisms for knowledge
   sharing and creation, and a dynamic umbrella strategy to give direction
   to the innovations. Lessons from product innovation should be applied:
   strategic project portfolio management and an aggregate project plan
   help to manage a balanced mix of projects and to allocate resources, and
   systematic project management shortens the lead time of change. Business
   process simulation, and learning from one development project to the
   next help to create a continuously improving business process innovation
   capability.

Abstract = {{The business enterprise has never been in greater need of Agility and
   the current trend will continue unabated well into the future. It is now
   recognized that information system is both the foundation and a
   necessary condition for,increased responsiveness. A successful
   implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) can help a company
   to move towards delivering on its competitive objectives as it enables
   suppliers to reach out to customers beyond the borders of traditional
   market defined by geography. The cost of implementation, even when it is
   successful, could be significant. Bearing in mind the potential
   strategic benefits, it is important that the implementation project is
   managed effectively, To this end a project cost model against which to
   benchmark ongoing project expenditure versus activities completed has
   been proposed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we highlight the involvement of Knowledge Management in a
   healthcare enterprise. We argue that the `knowledge quotient' of a
   healthcare enterprise can be enhanced by procuring diverse facets of
   knowledge from the seemingly placid healthcare data repositories, and
   subsequently operationalising the procured knowledge to derive a suite
   of Strategic Healthcare Decision-Support Services that can impact
   strategic decision-making, planning and management of the healthcare
   enterprise. In this paper, we firstly present a reference Knowledge
   Management environment-a Healthcare Enterprise Memory-with the
   functionality to acquire, share and operationalise the various
   modalities of healthcare knowledge. Next, we present the functional and
   architectural specification of a Strategic Healthcare Decision-Support
   Services Info-structure, which effectuates a synergy between knowledge
   procurement (vis-a-vis Data Mining) and knowledge operationalisation
   (vis-a-vis Knowledge Management) techniques to generate a suite of
   strategic knowledge-driven decision-support services. In conclusion, we
   argue that the proposed Healthcare Enterprise Memory is an attempt to
   rethink the possible sources of leverage to improve healthcare delivery,
   hereby providing a valuable strategic planning and management resource
   to healthcare policy makers. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Title = {{Small and medium enterprises in Slovakia focusing on tourism}},
Journal = {{EKONOMICKY CASOPIS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1173-1196}},
Abstract = {{The small and medium enterprise (SME) development is one of the assumes
   of favourable economic development in SR. It belongs, along with
   reclassification of the Slovak economy, to its main priorities. Despite
   favourable trends, the SME share of the most important indexes has been
   lower than in the EU countries. Due to barrier elimination on macro- and
   micro level, as well as, a significant state support and an effective
   support of the European Union and in context with other countries in the
   Middle and Eastern Europe, we can expect convergence towards the target
   values of SME in EU, considering this as a whole, as well as, within
   particular sector-branch segments of SME.
   Small and medium entrepreneurs achieve 51\% of the GDP formation, over
   62 employment share and 45\% export share, however, SME in Slovakia have
   got many reserves despite the relatively good shares.
   The SME are worth in difficult conditions of a new economy too,
   supposing they are markedly active and the state creates adequate
   business environment for them. They cannot stagnate in the new economy.
   They can follow one of two strategies: offensive or defensive, where
   both of them have got their strengths.
   The SME support in the Slovak conditions is very actual. Revaluation of
   the present forms of the SME support leads to the need of redirection
   from the tools bringing only a short-term effect towards the use of
   long-term character tools with a striking motivational effect. We should
   consider SME in Slovakia from its perspective effect point of view
   within the united European market too.
   Identification of SME in Slovakia, as well as, in other countries, can
   be done by comparison with analogue SME partners in other countries
   which are interesting for us from a particular point of view. These are
   the countries of Middle and Eastern Europe and some developed countries
   (EU). But the simple fact faces big barriers related to the ``soft{''}
   market environment which is the result of present reform economic
   processes and their interpretation, as well as, with different objective
   index contents. The most of the legislative barriers within SME are
   represented by increased financial duties of the entrepreneurs which
   often have got a de-motivational character. It is necessary to support
   the creditor legal status, to apply the right of lien, to recover the
   capital market, to gain foreign investments, to support SME, to make the
   interest rates real and to reduce the tax duties of the entrepreneurs.
   The business environment problems mentioned above refer to tourism too,
   despite it has got its strengths, as follows: dynamics, low investment
   and import intensity (three times lower in tourism than in industry), a
   high share of direct labor there functions as the tool of unemployment
   reduction and the region development, minimized dead assets, exchange
   effect for the country etc. We can expect the principal changes after
   realization of the measures, as follows: working-out the Tourism
   Development Program for the sake of the region development, Tourism Fund
   formation, working-out and approval of the tourism legislative support,
   significant financial advertising support etc.
   The business success or failure reflects the financial situation of an
   enterprise in tourism. Thus the managers, as well as, the external
   subjects can discover many strengths or weaknesses of the enterprise,
   their causes and reasons by the analysis of the business financial
   situation,. of the company and, upon this, to make decisions or accept
   proper arrangements.
   We cannot be satisfied with the development results and trends of
   particular financial indexes in the analyzed tourism enterprises-travel
   agencies, hotels and restaurants in Slovakia. The failure of the
   financial health is seen in a low profitability, often negative,
   relatively low liquidity, high indebtedness and long liability maturity
   periods. The short-term resources of the net operating capital are
   missing and the long-term financial resources formation is complicated
   too. Prevention can be found by respecting the need of the financial
   planning, within the flow management of the company and by change of the
   approach of the financial managers towards the formation of the
   financial resources of the company capital.}},

Abstract = {{The drive for information technology-led organizational and operational
   change in public administration has lagged behind that in the private
   sector: For good reasons, central public administrations are
   conservative by nature. Most public administrations are bureaucracies
   and bureaucracies tend to resist change. Nevertheless the pressure to
   obtain better Value from public administration information technology
   investments is growing and the debate as to how to achieve this is
   increasingly important. Part of this debate is concerned with how best
   to confront the formidable and specific challenges faced by the sector
   These include cultural, structural, resource and technical problems as
   well as a legacy of isolated developments which do not interrelate. The
   difficulties are compounded by the problems of evaluation generally in
   public administration - problems which are reflected in the evaluation
   of public sector information systems. This drive for change is reviewed
   and discussed in the context of the Irish civil service, in which there
   is a growing awareness of the strategic importance of breaking down
   specialized vertical systems and providing an integrated service to the
   citizen. A new approach to the problem, based on adapting the concept of
   business objects, is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents work carried out within the ``ExPlanTech{''} project
   (IST-1999-20171), funded by the, European Commission Information
   Technologies Programme. The mission of the ExPlanTech is to introduce,
   customize and exploit a multi-agent production planning technology
   (ProPlanT multi-agent system research prototype) in two specific
   industrial enterprises. An agent driven service negotiations and
   decision process based on usage-centered knowledge about task
   requirements substitutes the traditional production planning activity..
   We introduce methodology for integration of the project-driven
   production planning based on agent-based engineering within the existing
   enterprise resource planning system. This novel production planning
   technology will facilitate optimization of resource utilization and
   supplier chain while meeting, the customer demands.}},
