Abstract = {{Enterprise Resource Planning is a distinctive product, which has a
   tremendous impact and evolution on the software applications market.
   Although it is usually considered ``software for the rich{''}, ERP
   solutions are to be adopted, slowly but also firmly, even in developing
   countries, such as Romania.
   Based on Internet technologies, today's e-Business means full
   integration and collaboration, two vital keys to success. E-Business has
   reconfigured Enterprise Resource Planning. Using a web browser, any user
   can share information about the business processes and transactions.
   Therefore e-ERP\_tends to became less costly, easier to implement, more
   acceptable to the users and, finally, more affordable for the developing
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{As the central nervous system for managing an organization's mission and
   critical business data, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system has
   evolved to become the backbone of e-business implementation. Since an
   ERP system is multi-module application software that helps a company
   manage its important business functions, it should be versatile enough
   to automate every aspect of business processes, including e-business.

Abstract = {{Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software systems integrate key
   business and management processes within and beyond a firm's boundary.
   Although the business value of ERP implementations has been extensively
   debated in trade periodicals in the form of qualitative discussion or
   detailed case studies, there is little large-sample statistical evidence
   on whether the benefits of ERP implementation exceed the costs and
   risks. With multiyear multi-firm ERP implementation and financial data,
   we find that firms that invest in ERP tend to show higher performance
   across a wide variety of financial metrics. Even though there is a
   slowdown in business performance and productivity shortly after the
   implementation, financial markets consistently reward the adopters with
   higher market valuation (as measured by Tobin's q). Due to the lack of
   mid- and long-term post-implementation data, future research on the
   long-run impact of ERP is proposed.}},

   together promise organizations the benefits of enhancing competitiveness
   and continuous revitalization. This paper compares the characteristic
   differences and similarities between these two initiatives and examines
   how they influence organizational efficiency and flexibility when
   implemented within a global engineering firm. We suggest that the two

   metaroutines imposed by ERP and KM, and the social processes are
   nurtured within functions and cross-functionally.}},

Abstract = {{While pursuing mass customization (MC) strategies, companies often
   benefit from cooperating with others. From a customer's viewpoint,
   cooperating companies become a virtual enterprise (VE) that produces
   customer-individual goods. Participants of such a VE have to be
   extremely flexible in planning and executing their business processes.
   They have to be coordinated and supported by information systems (IS)
   that are particularly designed for these tasks. By focusing on the MC
   supply chain the basic data that is relevant to make successful MC
   strategies possible is identified At first, the MC-macro-process, the
   supporting IS, and the change of roles of the participants during this
   process will he discussed Based on this role concept and the common
   model of a VE for MC, relevant enterprise resource planning (ERP) data
   is identified.}},

Abstract = {{Firms around the world have been implementing enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) systems since the 1990s to have an uniform information
   system in their respective organizations and to reengineer their
   business processes. Through a case type analysis conducted in six
   manufacturing firms that have one of the widely used ERP systems,
   various contextual factors that influenced these firms to implement this
   technology were understood using the six-stage model proposed by Kwon
   and Zmud. Three types of ERP systems, viz. SAP, Baan and Oracle ERP were
   studied in this research. Implementation of ERP systems was found to
   follow the stage model. The findings from the process model were used to
   develop the items for the causal model and in identifying appropriate
   constructs to group those items. In order to substantiate that the
   constructs developed to measure the causal model were congruent with the
   findings based on qualitative analysis, i.e. that the instrument
   appropriately reflects the understanding of the case interview;
   `triangulation' technique was used. The findings from the qualitative
   study and the results from the quantitative study were found to be
   equivalent, thus, ensuring a fair assessment of the validity and
   reliability of the instrument developed to test the causal model. The
   quantitative measures done only at these six firms are not statistically
   significant but the samples were used as a part of the triangulation
   method to collect data from multiple sources, to verify the respondents'
   understanding of the scales and as an initial measure to see if my
   understanding from the qualitative studies were accurately reflected by
   the instrument. This instrument will be pilot tested first and
   administered to a large sample of firms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The continuing development of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
   has been considered by many researchers and practitioners as one of the
   major IT innovations in this decade. ERP solutions seek to integrate and
   streamline business processes and their associated information and work
   flows. What makes this technology more appealing to organizations is
   increasing capability to integrate with the most advanced electronic and
   mobile commerce technologies. However, as is the case with any new IT
   field, research in the ERP area is still lacking and the gap in the ERP
   literature is huge. Attempts to fill this gap by proposing a novel
   taxonomy for ERP research. Also presents the current status with some
   major themes of ERP research relating to ERP adoption, technical aspects
   of ERP and ERP in IS curricula. The discussion presented on these issues
   should be of value to researchers and practitioners. Future research
   work will continue to survey other major areas presented in the taxonomy
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply-chain management (SCM)
   have been growing In popularity across various industries. New
   initiatives in resources planning, electronic commerce and extended
   supply chain drive the trend among corporations towards integrating
   strategic business applications. ERP systems assist enterprises in
   automating and integrating corporate cross-functions such as inventory
   control, procurement, distribution, finance and project management.
   Through information sharing, SCM enables supply-chain partners to work
   in close coordination to facilitate supplier-customer interactions and
   minimize transaction cost. This research examines these two important
   concepts in terms of their evolution, functions and current development
   and further explores the rationales for their integration by analyzing
   the problems of ERP and presenting the solutions of SCM. This study is
   concluded with the imminent development of SCM and EPR systems and the
   industrial trend toward their integration.}},

Abstract = {{The realization of `intelligent and resource aware' distributed
   enterprises requires substantial development of the underpinning
   modelling, information management and knowledge representation
   technologies. This paper deals with the `resource-aware, aggregate
   planning' of manufacturing operations at early design stages. The term
   `resource aware' indicates the creation of a dynamic inter-relationship
   between the planning entities and the enterprise resources, humans and
   machines. The technologies employed for implementing the pilot methods
   include; a web-centric co-development environment, unique methods for
   enriching planning entities with knowledge, and a flexible engine
   supporting planning scenarios by using evolutionary computing for
   optimisation and capability analysis techniques for feedback evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a comparative case study of 13 industrial firms
   that implemented an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. It
   compares firms based on their dialectic learning process. All firms had
   to overcome knowledge barriers of two types: those associated with the
   configuration of the ERP package, and those associated with the
   assimilation of new work processes. We found that both strong core teams
   and carefully managed consulting relationships addressed configuration
   knowledge barriers. User training that included both technical and
   business processes, along with a phased implementation approach, helped
   firms to overcome assimilation knowledge barriers. However, all firms in
   this study experienced ongoing concerns with assimilation knowledge
   barriers, and we observed two different approaches to address them. In a
   piecemeal approach, firms concentrated on the technology first and
   deferred consideration of process changes. In a concerted approach, both
   the technology and process changes were undertaken together. Although
   most respondents clearly stated a preference for either piecemeal or
   concerted chance, all firms engaged in practices that reflected a
   combination of these approaches.}},

Abstract = {{An organizational competitiveness depends upon the effectiveness of
   information flow and subsequently the material flow. Information systems
   especially computer based ones greatly contribute to the effective
   communication within an organization whether it could be manufacturing
   or services. For companies to be competitive, they need to have access
   to ``the right kind of information at the right time{''}. An Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP) system can help to improve the communication
   within an organization. In this paper, the authors describe how SAP R/3
   software came in rescue of a potentially devastating inventory
   management situation in a large corporation with worldwide operations.
   The paper describes in detail the assessment of system requirements at
   various locations (production and storage facilities), configuration of
   SAP R/3 to meet those requirements, difficulties in system
   implementation, and benefits realized. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a critical approach to the way organizations justify
   adopting enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. An earlier critical
   theory provides a framework for exploring the themes of communication,
   rationality and domination. Technology, process and organization are
   forms of domination that may appear in the context of ERP adoption. The
   literature on the formal and informal (qualitative) justification of
   information technology investment is reviewed and assessed. The
   significance of ERP systems is examined and also motives for their
   adoption. The data used for the study are electronically mediated
   justifications of ERP adoption that were presented by universities. A
   content analysis is applied to these data. The paper concludes that,
   despite reservations about the sensitivity of domination and
   emancipation to identification and measurement, there is some evidence
   to suggest people are considered to occupy a subservient role to
   technology, process and organization.}},

Abstract = {{Although Enterprise Networks may be formed for different purposes, the
   need of integration always pops up. Integration requires interfaces,
   clear and consistent constructions of the communication. FLUENT (Flow
   Oriented Logistics Upgrade for Enterprise Networks) is a joint European
   project (Esprit IV) in which - among others - ERP (Enterprise Resource
   Planning) interfaces are defined and implemented for systems, like SAP
   and Baan. ERP systems provide proprietary interfaces, so FLUENT founded
   a common core interface specification easy to fit for any ERP interface.
   FLUENT ERP interface architecture defines XML schemas and
   transformations to convert a proprietary ERP data set to the format of
   another one and vice versa. This architecture is based on standardised
   XML solutions so exploits the advantages of the emerging XML trend.}},

Title = {{The dynamics of factors affecting the adoption of innovations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An abundance of IT innovations are constantly struggling for market
   acceptance. Various models have been proposed in the literature in order
   to aid understanding of the principles behind the adoption of IT
   innovations, but most of them implicitly assume that the factors
   explaining adoption decisions do not change over time. This study
   challenges that assumption and adds to the existing literature by
   investigating the dynamics of the factors influencing adoption. Our
   general proposition is that the driving factors in adopting innovations
   will change as the diffusion of the innovation in the market progresses.
   A large-scale empirical study was carried out among medium-sized
   companies in a variety of European countries and industries concerning
   the adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The
   findings strongly indicate that the factors affecting late adoption of
   ERP differ significantly from the factors explaining early adoption. At
   early stages of the diffusion process adoption tends to be especially
   driven by a combination of internal strategic drives and attitudes of
   the firm together with external forces like industry competition and
   supplier activities. Later on, the mix of adoption stimulating factors
   seems to be focusing more on implementation issues such as the
   scalability of the system, the number of seats and the yearly available
   budget. The study leads to both new methodological insights and
   substantive conclusions that also have practical implications. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The pressure for shorter product life cycles, improved quality,
   increased variety and increased competition that face today's
   manufacturing businesses create a relentless pressure for change and
   consequently the need for companies to stay abreast of the latest
   development in world best practices.
   One area of work that serves to integrate a number of best practices is
   the area of supply chain management (SCM). SCM is the management of
   materials and information flows both within and between facilities which
   occurs in the context of procurement, manufacturing, sales, distribution
   of goods, information and services across the entire supply chain (SC).
   The integration of configuration systems for supporting SCM of
   configurable products and services is still an open research issue. The
   importance of SCM is generally recognized. In this paper I argue that
   system development is now entering a new phase of maturity with the
   advent of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software packages, and
   a new software concept. Future research opportunities are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems require extensive
   configuration during which users come into extensive contact with the
   technical implementation team. Previous research examining other
   Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) modules has shown that user
   perception of the responsiveness of such teams, as an indicator of a
   possible social exchange, is significantly associated with an increased
   favorable assessment of the new system and ultimately its adoption, the
   reason being that perceived responsiveness creates a constructive social
   exchange. However, previous research, using survey data alone, did not
   examine causation. The objective of this study is to examine, using a
   quasi-experimental design, whether different degrees of actual
   responsiveness in different sites during CRM implementation result in
   significant differences in the users' favorable assessment of the
   correctness and ultimately their approval of a new CRM. The data support
   these hypotheses, but show that the downstream effects of actual
   responsiveness are mediated by perceived responsiveness. Implications
   concerning the social exchange relationship during CRM adoption are
   discussed.}},

   factors considered important for effective enterprise-level project
   management, and the current reality experienced by respondents. This

   performance.
   The management of task variability, combined with a clear understanding
   of both task and resource dependency at project level offers an avenue
   to shorten project lead-time and smooth workflow.
   Combined with an understanding of the impact of key resource constraints
   across a set of projects, it is possible to improve portfolio selection
   and pipeline staging.
   By focusing on key metrics in project planning and project execution,
   resource utilization can be maximized and projects completed with
   shorter lead times.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology and its wide range of applications have begun to
   make their presence in a new generation of logistic and distribution
   service industry. A more flexible breed of application packages Is
   emerging by the application of fourth generation language (4GL)
   technologies, which are able to provide foundations for true enterprise
   resource planning (ERP). There are many good reasons for adopting
   enterprise-wide resource planning systems. This research, however,
   focuses on the development of a human resource assignment module (HR
   module), usually considered as an essential part of an ERP system. This
   module provides crucial human resource data and supports decisions in
   human resource utilization in distribution center operations. We detail
   the crucial algorithm for the HR module, which provides efficient and
   effective manpower management for key logistic/distribution center
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{Many organizations have implemented Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
   systems to replace their legacy systems. ERP implementation changes the
   roles, responsibilities, and job characteristics of organizational
   participants. This study examined two issues. To what extent does
   enterprise resource planning implementation lead to work redesign and
   what is the impact of ERP initiated work redesign on employee job
   satisfaction? The sample frame for this research was made up of nine
   government organizations located in the Ottawa, Canada area, which have
   implemented the SAP R/3 enterprise resource system. Me Job
   Characteristic model proposed by Hackman and Oldham was used to analyze
   the work redesign. The research found that ERP implementation brought
   significant structural and cultural changes to these organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Information systems are continually expanding as evidenced by the
   doubling of Internet connections every year. Similar growth is exhibited
   by information systems in defense. The Air Force's goals to achieve
   global awareness, dynamic planning/execution, and global information
   exchange involve the technologies to provide information to the warrior
   anywhere, anytime, and for any mission. This far-reaching enterprise
   will necessarily span multiple networks and computing domains of both
   the commercial and military varieties. As a result, many users with
   different goals and priorities vie for the communication and computing
   resources of the information grid. Managing this vast system to assure
   dependable operation that maintains users' quality of service levels has
   led researchers to propose economic models to solve the resource
   management problem. Information technology has begun to fundamentally
   alter the way business is conducted, and there is synergy between
   e-commerce and the management of the underlying information resources on
   which it runs.
   This paper examines the envisioned market-based, large-scale information
   systems for defense. Due to their criticality, these systems must also
   manage resources to provide survivability in the presence of information
   attacks. This potential for technology transfer from the defense sector
   to the commercial sector are described. Conversely, the leveraging of
   research performed in the non-military realm of e-commerce to reach the
   Air Force's goals will also be explored.}},

   This paper proposes a methodology to support the integration of
   information flow between the applications of product data management
   (PDM) and manufacturing resource planning (MRP). A three-level structure
   including model development, model analysis, and system implementation
   was developed. An approach applying the concepts of semantic similarity
   to find the ``common{''} objects used in different business applications
   was also proposed. These objects were used as a buffer for the
   information integration. In addition, a set of business rules was
   developed to govern the information flow between PDM and MRP. The
   proposed methodology has been implemented by integrating two commercial
   PDM and MRP software modules.}},

Abstract = {{Faced with increasingly competitive markets, the need to reduce lead
   times and the need to react to customer demands more effectively,
   manufacturing resource planning (MR-PII) systems and computer-aided
   design (CAD) have become commonplace in manufacturing companies. These
   are, however, implemented in isolated and autonomous locations and
   without thought to their integration. Where integration is achieved
   technically, operational, philosophical and organisational issues have
   often presented an inaccurate and uncoordinated solution resulting in
   sustained bottlenecks between design, manufacturing planning and
   production processes. This document presents a case study of a
   manufacturing company facing these issues in a technology driven
   manufacturing strategy and proposes a framework to resolve them, based
   around matured Product Data Management (PDM) technologies. Learning the
   lessons from earlier direct application integration, the notion that
   integration of these systems is not only an issue of data but also
   business processes, as manufacturing companies embrace collaboration
   with their suppliers, customers and suppliers is also presented. This
   requires control, visibility and flexibility throughout enterprise
   information systems.}},

Abstract = {{Since early 1990s, many firms around the world have shifted their
   information technology (IT) strategy from developing information systems
   in-house to purchasing application software such as enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) systems. IT managers responsible for managing their
   organization's ERP implementation view their ERP systems as their
   organizations' most strategic computing platform. However, despite such
   strategic importance, ERP projects report an unusually high failure
   rate, sometimes jeopardizing the core operations of the implementing
   organization. This study explores the root of such high failure rate
   from an ``organizational fit of ERP{''} perspective. Based on the
   relevant literature, we define the concept of organizational fit of ERP
   and examine its impact on ERP implementation, together with ERP
   implementation contingencies. The results from our field survey of 34
   organizations show that ERP implementation success significantly depends
   on the organizational fit of ERP and certain implementation
   contingencies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the impact of software-driven process changes on
   manufacturing organizations. As packaged systems, rather than those
   developed for an individual company, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
   systems demand more than ever before that organizational subunits adapt
   their business processes to fit the imperatives of the software. The
   best practice line of thinking suggests that this ERP-driven business
   process change will yield positive organizational impacts. Thus, we
   present the following: H1: ERP systems result in organizational
   subunits' changing their business processes. H2: ERP-driven changes in
   business practices are associated with positive impacts of using the
   software. Hypotheses are evaluated using a test of mean difference and a
   Pearson correlation on data gathered from a pencil-and-paper survey
   directed at subunits of manufacturing businesses. Seventy-seven surveys
   were used. H1 was supported; H2 was not. The results call into question
   prescriptions from the literature about the superiority of so-called
   best practices as well as the blanket recommendations about the
   modification of organizational business processes to fit the
   capabilities of an ERP system. Results are also discussed in the context
   of several case studies.}},

Abstract = {{The article proposes a way to improve reference models for the
   management of virtual enterprises. The pattern of management roles is
   based on enveloping each decision centre into an agent wrapper, using
   the same tools and algorithms. Using this approach enterprises
   (organization, networks, virtual enterprises) will have the emergent
   agent property - the ability to follow objectives, plan, and take timely
   corrective action in case the plan breaks down.
   The resulting system has a dynamic, agile structure, where each
   decisional level (strategic, tactical, operational) may organize and
   re-organize the lower level according to the changes in objectives, or
   according to improvements in the capabilities or availability of
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the hierarchical production planning (HPP) problem
   of flexible automated workshops (FAWs), each of which has a number of
   flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). The objective is to decompose
   medium-term plans (assigned to an FAW by ERP/MRP II) into short-term
   plans (to be executed by FMSs in the FAW) for the highest business
   benefit. Here, ERP is short for enterprise resource planning and MRP II
   short for manufacturing resource planning. For practical purposes, the
   HPP problem is modeled after a linear programming (LP) model. Because
   the scale of the model for a general workshop is too large to be solved
   by the simplex method on a personal computer, Karmarkar's algorithm and
   an interaction/prediction algorithm are used to solve the model, the
   former for the large-scale problems and the latter for the very large
   scale. With the help of the programs written by using the
   above-mentioned algorithms and sufficient HPP examples, Karmarkar's
   algorithm, the interaction/prediction algorithm and the LP method in
   Matlab 5.0 are compared, the results showing that the proposed
   approaches are very effective. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the issues and solutions for the integration of
   enterprise information systems in the merger \& acquisition (M\&A)
   environment. Specific focus is on the result of a ramp to a newly
   integrated systems and ``zero rise-time{''} start-up approach in our
   merger situation. The business environment is changing rapidly,
   prompting mergers, acquisitions and alliances between enterprises as a
   global trend (Yokoyama, S., Strategy of alliance and confederacy,
   Toyokeizai shinpou, 1998 (Japanese)). Mass media is busy reporting M\&A
   (both cross-border and cross-industry), which were unimaginable
   combinations before. Integration of enterprise information processing
   systems, however, always remains a problem, even in this seemingly
   routine M\&A age, presenting difficulties to merged companies long after
   the merger (Mitsubishi Research Institute, in: Proceedings of the
   Innovation of Group Management and Measures of Computerization, 1999
   (Japanese)).
   At our firm, we have restructured business, integrating, discontinuing
   and partially splitting plant and business, and began as a new entity I
   October 1998 (Shibaura Mechatronics Corporation, in: Symphony, 1998
   (Japanese)). Through this process, we aimed at starting up and improving
   systems, with the intent of rapid deployment of such programs throughout
   the newly merged (integrated) company.
   Success factors are oriented toward subsystems distributed functionally
   and physically, full utilization of standard packaged software and
   combination of internal jobs and outsourcing (Shimada, T., Strategy of
   outsourcing, Nikkagiren, 1997 (Japanese)). Practical advantages obtained
   by our case study are discussed which shall be helpful to readers
   seeking an understanding of the dynamics effecting a M\&A program, since
   papers in this regard have relatively been few. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Traditional, functionally focused enterprises are proving to be the
   dinosaurs of organizational design - - incapable of adapting to an
   environment characterized by an ever-accelerating pace of change in
   economic, market, and technological realities. Success, and even
   survival, in these challenging times demands that all the resources of
   the enterprise be effectively utilized and integrated, permitting the
   enterprise to respond in an organic manner - - sensing its environment,
   integrating and transmitting that sensory information to all the organs
   necessary to develop and execute an appropriate response, learning from
   the experience, and institutionalizing the learnings in a readily
   accessible and shared bank of knowledge. Knowledge intensive enterprises
   must be designed and managed recognizing the need to effectively develop
   and leverage human capital, and to design operational, communication,
   and management processes and systems to support the people who use them.
   People can no longer be plugged in to predefined organizational boxes
   and system interfaces; rather, organizational designs, processes, and
   systems must adapt to the individual competencies, priorities, and needs
   of the individuals that constitute the enterprise. Managerial practices
   and systems that emerged at the dawn of the industrial age require a
   major overhaul to cope with the age of knowledge.
   Knowledge intensive organizations depend more on ad hoc structures,
   e.g., project teams, committees, cross-functional design groups,
   ``tiger{''} teams, etc. These tend to be process vs. functionally
   focused activities, executed through overlapping and interdependent
   networks of individuals. The networks can be analyzed, and ultimately
   synthesized and managed, by focusing on the fundamental elements of
   which they are constructed, interactions of pairs of individuals.
   Recognizing this, attempts have been made by sociologists and business
   anthropologists to utilize the concepts and tools of social network
   analysis to understand business enterprises. However, the efforts have
   had limited success in analyzing business processes, and have not
   generally been applied or adopted by managers for synthesis and
   management. The reason is while social networks are primarily associated
   with patterns of communication, the situation in a business enterprise
   is far more complex. However, in the business enterprise there exists a
   hierarchy of networks of decreasing dimension: communication networks
   associated with sharing information, influence networks associated with
   task prioritization and execution, and decision networks associated with
   enterprise governance, direction, and resource allocation. The situation
   is complicated by the fact that the networks are issue dependent, e.g.,
   strategic planning, product development, marketing, budgeting, etc.
   Furthermore, the networks are not independent, e.g., it is important to
   understand the sources and channels through which managers get the
   information on which they base their decisions, and how the decisions
   propagate through the organization to influence task selection and
   execution. The networks are not ``orthogonal,{''} that is the same
   individual may be active in several networks simultaneously. An
   additional complication is associated with the fact that the networks
   will generally be different depending on the modus of communication,
   e.g., different patterns and impact will be associated with face-to-face
   interchanges than with electronic interaction or paper communication.
   Finally, the patterns change with time. Circumstances, and evolving
   priorities and organizational membership.
   EnCompasse((R)){[}1], a computer supported system for organizational
   process visualization, analysis, synthesis, and management, was
   developed specifically to address these problems. The conceptual
   framework of EnCompasse is straightforward. Using a tailored data
   collection instrument, or DCI, (either paper or web-enabled),
   information is collected from the members of the organization (and
   external interfaces, as appropriate) about their individual interactions
   on selected issues of consequence. Each participant indicates the
   individuals with whom they have regular, task related interaction; the
   frequency of the interaction, on a numerical scale relevant to the
   particular study; the importance that they perceive the interaction has
   for task execution on a numerical scale ranging from unimportant to
   critical; and the impact that the interactions have on decisions related
   to each of the issues. Other parameters such as the modus and duration
   of the interactions are included as relevant. The system integrates the
   bi-nodal interaction information to produce three-dimensional
   representations of the patterns of interactions around individual
   issues, or logical combinations of issues, in response to structured
   queries utilizing sets of parameters (or parameter ranges) selected from
   the fields included in the DCL The links that result from these analyses
   are overlaid on the formal organizational hierarchy, or on a influence
   based hierarchy developed by the analysis of the responses.
   The system can not only clarify ``what{''} is happening, but can also
   provides some insights into ``why.{''} The attributes of the
   participants that may be anticipated to influence the patterns of
   interactions (e.g., discipline, function, location, organization,
   current or prior program experience, special competencies, tenure, etc.)
   can be included in fields attached to the records of the participants.
   The system provides for filtering the views using a logical combination
   of attributes to determine the characteristics or attributes that are
   common to nodes in the networks.
   In this paper the application of this methodology to the management of
   knowledge intensive enterprises will be illustrated with industrial
   cases in the high technology sector.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Research of manufacturing execution systems (MESs) has been conducted to
   integrate ERP and physical operational systems, so a fully automated and
   integrated manufacturing management environment can be developed.
   However, as subcontracting becomes common in industries, a single MES is
   not enough and it is necessary to develop distributed MESs to integrate
   the distributed operations. This research proposes a distributed
   workflow model to develop such a system. IN the workflow model, there
   are three cooperation types for defining the relationships between an
   action and resources. Six relational patterns are defined for the
   relationships between actions.
   This research also reviews current information technologies, including
   data acquisition and control (DAC) components, control software's ASP
   .NET, and CLIPS, for supporting the development of distributed workflow
   models. Additionally, this research proposes using a collaborative
   workflow-based protocol (CWP) to form a distributed workflow. CWP is
   based on the integration of Internet technology and CLIPS. It is found
   that the proposed structure may ease the decision process of forming a
   distributed workflow.
   In summary, this article reports a cutting edge approach for the
   development of distributed manufacturing execution systems. The results
   show solutions for integrating high-level planning systems, such as ERP,
   and low-level operational systems through information technologies.}},

   of the project-driven production planning based on agent-based
   engineering within the existing enterprise resource planning system.
   This novel production planning technology will facilitate optimization
   of resource utilization and supplier chain while meeting the customer
   demands. This paper describes a FIPA-compliant implementation of the

Abstract = {{Today many industrial enterprises have to meet several challenges like
   individual customer production, enterprise resource planning, electronic
   market places, B2C and B2B communication as well as E-commerce
   applications. In this context supporting information systems are
   required, which allow the integration of heterogeneous software systems
   and the corresponding data sources in order to optimize both
   collaboration of in-house software components and data communication
   with other business partners. For industrial enterprises efficient
   management of product data is of major importance because it
   significantly increases the productivity of engineers and organizations
   that deal with information involved in the process of designing,
   manufacturing and maintaining a product. Electronic data interchange
   (EDI) is the most important prerequisite for electronic collaboration
   and E-commerce applications.
   This paper introduces a rule-based product data manager to enable
   integrated management of a large amount of product data as well as data
   interchange between several CIM components. To provide flexible and
   easy-to-use EDI mechanisms with other business partners or between
   different CIM components, a configurable interface for EDI is
   introduced. In this approach knowledge about data structures and data
   formats is separated from the file generation process. This knowledge is
   transformed into a meta data structure represented by XML DTDs. Data
   transmission is done by making use of the advantages of XML and Internet
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{In several industrialised countries, there have occurred initiatives to
   establish eco-industrial parks. Originally, these were mainly based upon
   the exchange of resources between heavy industries in industrial
   complexes. These initiatives are generally referred to with the concepts
   of industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks. Since then, the
   concept of eco-industrial parks has been extended to another relevant
   type of industrial park, the so-called mixed industrial park, which
   consists of various small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
   sometimes complemented by a small number of larger industries. Because
   of the resulting growing ambiguity in the significance of eco-industrial
   park initiatives, a typology is desirable for entangling the confusion
   that is introduced. It is argued that mixed industrial parks are poorly
   investigated although they have a major environmental and spatial
   impact, Starting from a general consideration of eco-industrial park
   initiatives, this paper describes the societal and environmental
   problems that are related to the mixed industrial parks, proposes
   solutions and discusses the counteracting factors. While our argument
   relates strongly to the traditionally industrialised countries, it is
   also relevant to newly industrialised countries, as they are faced with
   similar problems, or will encounter them in the near future. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The HART protocol was established as an open, de-facto industry standard
   in 1990. More than 10 million installed devices are in operation
   worldwide benefiting from HART communication. A traditional view shared
   by many in the user community is that data from the intelligent
   HART-capable field instruments is only obtainable via a standard hand
   held terminal. The reality is far from the perception. This paper
   describes how a personal computer based server productivity tool can use
   HART communication to connect one or more intelligent instruments to the
   rest of the enterprise. The server, which is based on the OPC standard,
   enables application software packages such as SCADA/HMI software,
   Internet web browser, Excel spreadsheet, SQC/SPC, MES, DCS, and
   Enterprise Resource Planning software to receive real-time information
   from HART-capable instrumentation. The open system standard based
   approach results in lower integration costs and improved productivity
   for a very small investment.}},

Abstract = {{The first ERP systems were introduced in Indian organizations in the
   late 1990. The ERP segment in India grew by 23 percent during 1999-2000,
   and at the end of 2000, more than 200 organizations had either
   implemented ERP software or were in the process of doing so. Yet, there
   are no empirical studies or conceptual frameworks within which the
   experiences of Indian organizations with ERP can be analyzed This paper
   proposes a three-stage model for analyzing the deployment of EPP in
   Indian organizations. Each stage describes a specific aspect of the
   implementation exercise, and can be used to guide the implementation
   process. The characteristics of each stage and their implications for
   managers have also been discussed The model is based on an empirical
   study of 25 EPP implementation exercises carried out in organizations
   from 10 industries.}},

Abstract = {{Timeliness, coherence, and correctness of information and data flow
   between the shop floor and the upper level planning systems in an
   enterprise is critical to the decision making in response to internal
   and external conditions. How much each decision contributes to the value
   an enterprise generates depends on the quality of the information flow
   among the various levels within the enterprise.
   Uncertainties in manufacturing environment due to internal and external
   disturbances necessitates that shop floor control is dynamic in nature.
   Data collected through shop floor control systems have to be passed in
   an appropriate format to other production planning and control modules
   in real time. Providing a seamless flow of information will complement
   the upper level enterprise resource planning (ERP) modules by providing
   data with minimum latency. In this way, planned orders will be scheduled
   effectively along with backlog orders based on the real-time status of
   the manufacturing equipment, the amount of inventory will be known at
   all times, and the quality control problems will be reported in
   real-time to avoid further problems. From the standpoint of supply chain
   management, the impact of providing real time data on events and
   decisions at any level is much critical owing to the involvement of
   several enterprises, wherein their business processes are highly
   integrated. At this level, real time data helps in such as knowing the
   status of a particular customer order, providing accurate delivery time
   of orders, and making robust preventive plant maintenance plans.
   This paper is focused on the information flow gap between the production
   environment and upper level enterprise resource management levels, with
   emphasis on master planning, which acts as a link between the
   manufacturing systems, suppliers and market. Information flow is
   analyzed from two perspectives: (1) Within the organization, and (2)
   Across the supply chain. Various manufacturing environments are compared
   from the perspective of responsiveness and agility.}},

Abstract = {{Complementary Processes (CP) are used to form Complementary
   Collaborative Processes. The collaborative processes perform individual
   functions of the Information System (IS). A group of collaborative
   processes can be referred to as a Complementary Production Lines (CPL).
   Each of the processes of a CPL is performing it's task concurrently and
   In-Concert with its associated tasks or Side-by-Side. When associated
   tasks are performing Side-by-Side and In-Concert, it is synonymous with
   parallel processing. CPL's are used as a method to expand the
   computation resources of Processors. These methods are not available in
   current resources. This will allow the scalability of software (SW)
   resources to grow linearly and/or from 1 Processor to ``N{''}
   Processors. This is a method of obtaining parallel processing from
   Serial Processes. When Collaborative Processes of one Processor are
   performing Side-by-Side, with other similar Processors, this action is
   synonymous with parallel Processors and/or Replication of SW Processors.
   Replication or duplication of Processors is a method for linear
   expandability, Fault Tolerance, and Availability that approaches 100\%.
   This will allow the enterprises to have an integrated IS System that
   begins with it's primary Users (Hand Held Devices or Thin Clients),
   progress through intermediate layers of Processors, and terminate in a
   ``Central Repository.{''} The commonality of the system, for each
   processor, is COTS HW, COTS OS's, and CP SW. With CP, the communication
   transfer times are in the millisecond ranges. All data transfers can
   occur concurrently, using common communication links'. The Hand-Held
   Processor could process or elicit data from the Enterprise Repositories
   in the Ten's of milliseconds (communication transit time not included).
   This is a giant step forward for data processing and data sharing.}},
