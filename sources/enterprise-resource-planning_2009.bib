Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation is probably the
   most laborious and rather costly part of the ERP system life-cycle. The
   paper provides a percentage structure of total cost of implementation
   (TCI) from end-user company's perspective. It should be of interest to
   companies planning to implement ERP systems, since literature suggests
   that TO can be 3-5 times higher than the software license alone. TCI is,
   for purpose of this paper, split into the following four parts: software
   license, programming of changes, organizational implementation, and
   hardware costs. ERP systems used to be a domain of large companies but
   there is a still increasing number of small and middle enterprises
   (SMEs) adopting them as well. Based on research done in Slovenia and
   Slovakia, the impact of the different company size, the country,
   existence of formal information strategy, representation of the IT
   department on the board level, and turnover growth on individual parts
   of TCI is analyzed and findings are discussed.}},

   have to face some challenges derived from complex technology and
   management How to manage information resources, use IT effectively,
   realize IT value, and align IT with business is the big objective and
   issue of every organization. Information Resources Planning is the
   foundation of informationlization. After introducing the theory and
   method of IRP, this paper describes a new HIP methodology based on
   Systematic Thinking, which is Enterprise Architecture. An HIP approach
   based on EA is presented in detail in the paper. And R case study on a
   Chinese manufacturer is made as an example to illustrate this approach.}},

Abstract = {{General purpose enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have problems
   such as complex configuration processes, low adaptation to specific
   industries, and an extensive implementation time period. In order to
   alleviate these issues, this paper proposes the concept of
   industry-oriented ERP (IERP) and a component-based approach to IERP
   development. This paper also presents the framework of developing IERP
   in which business process modelling and software reuse are employed as
   primary methods to improve the operability of component-based IERP. The
   framework consists of five layers including server layer, team work
   supporting layer, IERP construction and customisation layer, reusable
   assets and toolset layer, and the IERP system instance layer. These
   layers as well as their relationship with each other are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multi-method analysis of the implementation of an
   enterprise resource planning system. It argues the majority of research
   treats these systems as having essential technical properties that
   enable them to bring about positive organisational effects. In contrast,
   we adopt a post-essentialist perspective that understands discourse as
   constructing ERP systems, rather than reflecting their essential
   properties. Discourse analysis of interviews and focus groups was used
   to compare justifications for the implementation produced by members of
   the ERP project team with end users' reactions to the system. In
   contrast to previous studies, this opens the ERP black box by
   illustrating how the capabilities of these systems, and their
   organisational effects, are constructed through language. Moreover, it
   demonstrates the important function these constructions perform in
   legitimising or undermining ERP implementation. Statistical analysis of
   post-implementation questionnaires identified the predictors of
   established measures of users' reactions to IT systems. By comparing
   these data with end users' discursive reactions to the project, we
   identify several constructs for inclusion in future studies of users'
   reactions to ERP systems. The paper concludes by summarising the
   contributions and limitations of the study and its implications for
   future research and practice.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation and adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   system is currently a key issue for companies. The critical problem of
   implementing and adopting ERP system is that the system architectures
   are quite complex. This study focuses on the integration of the human
   factors issues in the ERP implementation process. The mental or
   cognitive differences between information systems concerning people and
   end users are compared in this Study based on information related
   theories. This paper proposes a human-centered system implementation and
   adoption model. The main purpose of this model is to assist the ERP
   system implementation and adoption and creates maximum customer value.
   The paper shows how to carry out the model step by step with the final
   goal of increasing the efficiency and acceptability of the system to be
   implemented and adopted.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the critical success
   factors (CSFs) of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system
   implementation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
   Design/methodology/approach - Five case studies of Canadian SMEs were
   conducted. They included interviewing individuals from five roles at
   each organization and gathering project documents. Following an
   evaluation of each project's success (within-case analysis), cross-case
   analysis was conducted to elicit influential and distinctive factors.
   Findings - Factors were identified that appeared to explain variation
   between successful and unsuccessful implementations at SMEs, besides
   factors that appeared to be innovative or counter-intuitive in light of
   the established literature.
   Research limitations/implications - The study reinforces the need for
   more research that is focused on SMEs. All cases were of Canadian SMEs
   with either a manufacturing or distribution focus, potentially limiting
   the generalizability of findings to other industries or countries.
   Practical implications - By identifying relevant CSFs for SMEs, managers
   can better prioritize implementation efforts and resources to maximize
   success of ERP implementations.
   Originality/value - The paper appears to be one of the first studies to
   focus Oil the CSFs of ERP implementation at SMEs.}},

Abstract = {{In modern era, the trend of global economic development and
   globalization has been increasingly intensive. In order to maintain
   competitive advantages, construction enterprises all over the world are
   always adopt the method of ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning)to improve
   operation efficiency. The aspect that most concerned by construction
   enterprises which have adopted ERP is that what are the influences and
   economic benefits ERP will bring to these enterprises. Balanced
   Scorecard is though the combination of finance target and non- finance
   target to contact the performance measurement and implementation of the
   strategy, design a set of target systems which can help senior managers
   to understand the situation of the enterprise performance. This paper
   introduces the concept of Balanced Scorecard(BSC), studies the
   corresponding relationship between the supply chain of ERP and the
   causation chain of BSC according to the characteristics of ERP and
   discusses the performance measurements system based on BSC under the
   condition of ERP, at the same time use the expert evaluation method. At
   last, we discuss how construction enterprises conduct performance
   management effectively.}},

Abstract = {{The paper addresses the alignment between business processes and
   information technology in enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   implementation. More specifically, we concentrate on one of the key
   decisions at the tactical alignment level: the decision on the
   implementation sequence of the ERP modules. Since the module sequencing
   problem involves a myriad of organizational and technical issues,
   connected to each other in networked manner, the analytic network
   process (ANP) methodology is applied. As a result of the study, we
   present first a general level conceptual framework to sequence ERP
   module implementations and expand the model to a more detailed level in
   a case study. The priorities for the implementation sequence of the ERP
   modules are determined in the case study. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The appearance and development of e-business brings great impact on
   every industry. It also brings profound revolution in construction
   enterprises' management ideas and patterns. The traditional framework of
   construction enterprise management information system (MIS) is
   challenged by the change. Using e-business in construction enterprises
   is a necessary tide of them development both of information and
   construction enterprises themselves.
   This paper firstly summarizes the current situation of e-business, then
   analyzes the disadvantages of traditional MIS models, and discusses the
   new functions of construction enterprises MIS for e-business. Based on
   the thoughts of integrating the information of all partners' and also
   integrating the information technique with operation flow in
   construction enterprises, this paper builds up a e-business-oriented MIS
   model that includes interior data flow on Intranet and exterior data
   flow on Internet. Modem management ideas and methods such as Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP), life circle management, total management and
   supply chain management are used. Finally, it analyzes the design of
   ERP, project management system, supply chain management system and
   business intelligence system, the integration among the subsystems and
   data integration between enterprise MIS and the relevant exterior
   platforms. The research will be very useful to the successful use of
   e-business in construction enterprises and approving their core
   competence fundamentally.}},

Abstract = {{Although enterprise resource planning (ERP) has been widely adopted
   since its first appearance in the early 1990s, there is a lack of
   research regarding ERP investment justification and performance
   evaluation. In this paper, based on an activity-based costing (ABC)
   analysis, we propose a framework to quantify the cost savings that the
   implementation of an ERP system should achieve in order to make the
   investment justifiable. Exploiting the ability of ABC to trace costs to
   activities and products, ERP resource costs and activities are
   identified and the cost structure of products is analysed. It is also
   shown that the ABC approach can enhance the visibility of business
   processes with various activities and cost drivers and provide
   information about actions to be taken to raise profits by cost savings
   or increased revenues. Finally, a numerical example is used to
   demonstrate how an ERP system is utilized on activities and how it
   affects the cost of products. An extensive analysis follows to address
   how the results can be used to direct process improvement toward
   corporate goals.}},

Abstract = {{To fully exploit the capabilities of complex technologies, businesses
   must deliberately foster technology acceptance by end users. This
   deliberate activity must recognize the complexity of factors that
   influence individuals' perceptions, intentions, and usage of information
   technology. This study surveyed 66 professionally autonomous end users
   and gathered information on their perceptions related to several
   technology acceptance factors for a newly installed enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) system component. Study analyses focused on end user
   perceptions of ERP component usefulness, their intention to use the
   system, and self-reported usage of a system component. Valuable insights
   into the perceptions of professional end users toward a component of a
   complex technology were gained. Recommendations based upon the results
   of this study include: (a) clearly describe, early in the implementation
   process, an overall picture of the ERP system flow and visually show end
   users how the components they use ``fit{''} into the whole system; (b)
   convert ERP-related ``tech talk{''} to common end user language by
   either clear explanation of unique terms or associations of new terms to
   ones commonly Understood by end users, and (c) provide adequate
   resources (financial, physical, human, etc.) to ensure that end users
   have access to timely support. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Early enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems or, more simply,
   enterprise systems (ES), were not primarily focused on the supply chain.
   Their initial focus was to execute and integrate such
   internally-oriented applications that support finance, accounting,
   manufacturing, order entry, and human resources. Having got their
   internal operations somewhat integrated, many organizations have moved
   on to address the supply chain with their ES. The Internet has also
   brought about a revolution in supply chain thinking. Progress toward
   complete inter-enterprise integration is measured in years and even
   decades. In this article, we discuss both the visions firms have for
   using enterprise systems for supply chain management, and the actual
   reality of current implementation. We conclude with projections of how
   enterprise systems will be used for supply chains in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Resource planning is an integral component of service chain management
   as it ensures that customer commitments are met, that a high quality of
   service is maintained and that operational costs are kept as low as
   possible. Service enterprises with varied, manifold service offerings
   often employ large, diverse workforces to deliver their services. Such
   resource planning scenarios are particularly challenging as different
   types of services often require individual planning approaches but, at
   the same time, the aim is to resource plan for the entire workforce to
   guarantee an optimal overall balance. In this paper, we propose an
   integrated approach to resource planning for diverse workforces that
   combines the ability to plan separately and differently for distinct
   service categories with the ability to maintain control of and balance
   the entirety of resources. Furthermore, we present FieldPlan-90 as a
   real life case study that realizes this integrated resource planning
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this paper is to identify the factors
   associated with computing satisfaction for existing legacy systems and
   the perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of an enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) system for Thai university staff. Questionnaires were
   used as a means to gain insights and perspective of ERP systems in Thai
   universities. The results found significant relationships between
   university tenure and system satisfaction, and that computer experience,
   age, prior knowledge and education were significantly related to ERP
   perceptions. Diversity is also required in administration staff to allow
   new ideas to be recognised and exploited. This study has investigated
   ERP as a new innovation at a very early stage in Thai universities. This
   research study has shown that potential adopters of ERP do have
   uncertainty about a new innovation and this compels them to find out
   more information about the innovation. Any efforts at persuasion should
   be staged over a period of time to allow a build-up of knowledge to
   occur in organisations that implement ERP. ERP training could then focus
   on explaining the advantages of ERP over the existing system, while
   providing users with `hands on' experience of an ERP system.}},

Abstract = {{The Paper aim is to find the best opportunity for the Romanian
   companies, through combing the attraction of EU's structural funds for
   increasing the competitiveness (amounted to 2,554 billion euro for
   Romania). and using the best Enterprise Resource planning (ERP) software
   solution for offered by the most experienced software companies (the
   largest ERP vendors worldwide according to Gartner Dataquest are SAP
   with 28.7 market share. Oracle with 10.2 and Microsoft with 3.7. The
   authors have made a previous research in the field of ERP implementation
   in Romanian companies ( ERP implementation in the whole Romanian mining
   industry, in 2004 year). That research was based on a managerial
   research, made over 9 companies and 40 firms having over 47.000 employ.
   The study, was focused on the IT level of this companies, and has reveal
   many interesting facts about hard and soft facilities and also about ERP
   implementation. Now the authors have made a similar managerial research
   over companies from different areas of activity. companies that have
   implemented a ERP. CRM or SCM software using the software made by
   representative ERP software companies (SIVECO, Oracle and Microsoft).
   After 2007 (using the opportunity of the National Strategic Reference
   Framework (NSRF) 2007-2013) in conjunction with the 2008 financial
   -economic crisis, all Romanian companies must use the Sector Operational
   Program (SOP) ``Increase of Economic Competitiveness{''} for
   implementing the e-economy (a collection of enterprise resource planning
   (ERP), customer relationship Management (CRM), and supply-chain
   management (SCM) computer application). and some of them have already
   made it, and the paper present such results. Because Romania attract
   only a few EU structural funds, and also because the ERP implementation
   in Romania has a low rate, such a research had never been made, for the
   Romanian companies, and also the conclusion are very useful for a best
   ERP implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology (IT) projects are susceptible to changes in the
   business environment, and the increasing velocity of change in global
   business is challenging the management of enterprise systems such as
   enterprise resource planning (ERP). At the same time, system success
   depends on the rigor of the project management processes. Scope creep,
   poor risk management, inadequate allocation of human resources over
   time, and vendor management are some common problems associated with the
   implementation of an enterprise system. These issues pose threats to the
   success of a large-scale software project such as ERP. This research
   adopts a case study approach to examine how poor project management can
   imperil the implementation of an ERP system. Having learned the lessons
   from the failure of its first ERP implementation, the company in this
   case reengineered its project management practices to successfully carry
   out its second ERP implementation. Many critical project management
   factors contributed to the failure and success of this company's ERP
   system. This study explores and identifies critical elements of project
   management that contributed to the success of the second ERP
   implementation. For those organizations adopting ERP, the findings
   provide a roadmap to follow in order to avoid making critical, but often
   underestimated, project management mistakes.}},

Abstract = {{The proportion of the knowledge worker in enterprise is increasing by
   analysis of the number of graduates from universities and undergraduates
   still in universities, enrollment and the trends of their change, the
   knowledge workers' management becomes more important than before. To the
   retrospect of the development course of human resources management in
   developed countries, the knowledge workers{''} management and general
   workers' management is significantly different. Career planning plays
   key role in the knowledge workers' management. Due to lack of career
   planning in Chinese enterprises, especially private ones, there are two
   main problems in the knowledge workers' management: First, the knowledge
   workers lack the sense of identity with the enterprises. It is difficult
   to according their self values to the enterprise's development, which
   cause frequently job-hopping phenomenon; second, considering the
   knowledge workers change their jobs frequently, the enterprises always
   lack of investment in their employees' farther education and vocational
   development. To get rid of the wrong cycle in knowledge workers'
   management, we must enhance career planning, motivate the knowledge
   workers of the enterprises, identify the knowledge workers with the
   enterprises they worked and feel successful based on the exact
   developing goals.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the current
   literature base of critical success factors (CSFs) of enterprise
   resource planning (ERP) implementations, provide a systematic
   compilation of CSFs, and present a new comprehensive taxonomy of CSFs
   for ERP system implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper compiles literature that
   highlighted possible references to CSFs for ERP implementation projects.
   Given that the purpose of this paper is to achieve a depth of
   understanding of the various CSFs already identified by other
   researchers, ``content analysis{''} is used. Four stages of content
   analysis are adopted to collect and analyse the literature, i.e. data
   collection, open coding, axial coding, and selective coding.
   Findings - By analyzing all CFSs mentioned in literature during the last
   ten years (1999-2008), taxonomy of ERP CSFs implementation was
   formulated. In total 17 CSFs were identified, which is then categorized
   into five main categories.
   Research limitations/implications - Literature is collected from
   selected databases and journals from 1999 to 2008.
   Practical implications - This paper is significant because taxonomy
   helps us organize the knowledge. Taxonomy can help the researchers to
   make their search easier by assigning CSFs to a category and defining
   relationships between those categories.
   Originality/value - The output of this paper will help future
   researchers to increase identification of related studies in the
   literature review phase of their work.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have become more and more
   common in enterprises, not only in large enterprises but also in small
   and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Although virtually nobody really
   doubts their importance for running a business, some even consider ERP
   systems to be a de facto price of entry for running a business, as there
   is sentiment regarding their implementation - both in terms of time and
   money. The question asked in this paper is to what extent ERP system
   implementation costs exceed planned costs in SMEs within a European
   context that is characterized by, for instance, fixed price policy. Our
   literature review suggests lack of empirical research in this field as
   such, and especially in SMEs in the European context (as opposed to the
   North American). The questionnaire research which focused on this issue
   was conducted in Denmark, Slovakia and Slovenia. The dependent variable
   was a percentage of actual ERP system implementation costs vis-a-vis the
   planned ones. The independent variables were country, company size,
   information strategy, and representation of the IT department on board
   level. According to the collected data, companies with information
   strategy were more likely to stay on budget. It seems that SMEs in all
   countries did not have extra resources for unplanned ERP system-related
   expenditures, as it might have been the case in large enterprises.
   Although surprising that representation of the IT department on board
   level did not automatically result in fewer overruns, it may be argued
   that, for example, CIOs were likely not only to manage implementation
   projects better, but were also able to request additional funds for
   unplanned customizations or training. Overall, 74.2\% of companies
   stayed on budget, and on average, companies spent 104.3\% of what they
   originally planned to spend. These results suggest a higher success rate
   in European SMEs than in American ones surveyed by Standish Group.}},

Abstract = {{his paper contributes to the literature on enterprise resource planning
   (ERP) by pursuing two objectives. First, it identifies configurations of
   ERP adopters that have similar needs and develop similar competencies.
   Second, it tests the hypothesis that, to maximize benefits from their
   ERP projects, organizations should align their ERP competence-building
   mechanisms with the ERP needs that arise from their operational
   environment. The analysis of a sample of manufacturing companies that
   implemented ERP between 1995 and 2001 uncovers four distinct
   configurations representing different degrees of fit between needs and
   competence-building mechanisms: the frugal ERP, the extensive business
   process reengineering (BPR), the adaptive ERP, and the straitjacket. The
   results support our hypothesis and suggest that the consequences of a
   misfit between needs and competence-building mechanisms are more severe
   for companies that operate in complex and dynamic environments and have
   informal organizational structures than for firms with rigid structures
   that operate in simple and stable environments.}},

Title = {{A classification model of ERP system data quality}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2009}},

Number = {{8-9}},
Pages = {{1053-1068}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In literature, there is not agreement on the relevant data
   quality dimensions in an enterprise Accepted 7 February 2009 resource
   planning (ERP) system context. The purpose of this paper is to provide
   some clarification of this topic, by answering two important questions:
   What are the most relevant dimensions for assessing ERP data quality?
   What are the causal relationships between these data quality dimensions?
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on a discussion of existing
   literature on data quality, a classification model of ERP system data
   quality is proposed and the relationships between the defined categories
   of data quality dimensions are defined. The validity of the
   classification model and the relationships between categories of data
   quality dimensions are investigated in three case studies.
   Findings - The three case studies confirm that the classification model
   captures the most important aspects of describing ERP data quality and
   that the defined causalities between categories of data quality
   dimensions correspond with practice.
   Research limitations/implications - Besides being relevant in an ERP
   system context, the contribution of this paper may also be applicable
   for the evaluation of data quality in other types of information
   systems.
   Practical implications - The defined classification model of ERP system
   data quality may support companies in improving their ERP data quality,
   thereby achieving greater benefits from their ERP systems.
   Originality/value - A clarification of the most important data quality
   aspects in an ERP context is provided. Furthermore, some of the most
   important causalities between categories of data quality are defined.}},

Title = {{Process efficiency of the enterprise resource planning adoption}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{8-9}},
Pages = {{1085-1100}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the performance of
   business processes, operational process efficiency and profitability of
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) pre- and post-adoption in the long
   term. The paper also aims to examine the factors of ERP supplier types
   and firm size in Taiwan.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper measures business process
   (structure capital value added and operational expense ratio), process
   efficiency (account receivable turnover and inventory turnover) and
   profitability (continuing operating income and net profit margin) of
   pre- and post-adoption ERP. First, the overall samples are tested.
   Second, ERP performances are compared, classified as large, medium and
   small. Finally, the ERP performances, classified as international and
   local supplier, are compared using the Wilcoxon rank test.
   Findings - The results show that the business process, process
   efficiency, and profitability increase in the fourth or fifth years.
   This shows that the benefits of ERP are evident in the long term.
   Regarding firm size, big firms enhance their business process through
   process efficiency and financial performance. Medium-sized firms raise
   continuing operating income only in the first five years. Small firms
   show no improvement. The results show that the business process,
   relating to process efficiency and profitability, demonstrates
   significant improvements in implementing international ERP vendors.
   Adversely, firms using local ERP systems have a diminished outcome in
   overall performance.
   Practical implications - This paper suggests that when companies plan to
   adopt an ERP system, large firms possess more advantages than
   medium-sized or small firms and international ERP vendors are preferable
   to local systems.
   Originality/value - Previous research has rarely compared the results of
   process reengineering after ERP system implementation. This paper offers
   insight into ERP adopters in the electronics industry.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have gained major prominence
   by enabling companies to streamline their operations, leverage and
   integrate business data process. In order to implement an ERP project
   successfully, it is necessary to select an ERP system which can be
   aligned with the needs of the company. Thus, a robust decision making
   approach for ERP software selection requires both company needs and
   characteristics of the ERP system and their interactions to be taken
   into account. This paper develops a novel decision framework for ERP
   software selection based on quality function deployment (QFD), fuzzy
   linear regression and zero-one goal programming. The proposed framework
   enables both company demands and ERP system characteristics to be
   considered, and provides the means for incorporating not only the
   relationships between company demands and ERP system characteristics but
   also the interactions between ERP system characteristics through
   adopting the QFD principles. The presented methodology appears as a
   sound investment decision making tool for ERP systems as well as other
   information systems. The potential use of the proposed decision
   framework is illustrated through an application. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In recent years, China's dairy industry has experienced great progress.
   But low operating efficiency has been the bottleneck of its development.
   This paper has analyzed operating efficiency of dairy enterprises based
   on the model of C(2)R-DEA and C(2)GS(2)-DEA model, which has come to the
   conclusion that there is great gap among overall efficiency of different
   dairy enterprises. Meanwhile, only three enterprises' overall efficiency
   has reached 1, which shows that overall efficiency of China's dairy
   industry is rather low and these enterprises have not made full use of
   resources. This paper uses the effective DEA decision-making as the
   reference sample and proposes corresponding plans for the improvement of
   China's dairy industry.}},

Abstract = {{As society progresses, human resources management will be facing more
   challenges, and a knowledge - based senior managerial and technical
   talent scarcity is the most challenging. The flow of talents is normal
   for construction enterprise. It will definitely hinder the normal
   operation of enterprises if the flow of talents, particularly advanced
   talents drain, is too frequent. We need to seriously think not only how
   to use the talents, but also how to retain the talents. According to the
   long-term goal of the enterprise, we should seriously study the
   enterprise human resources planning, establish the effective incentive
   mechanism, form the well enlightened corporate culture, and always keep
   the enterprise with vitality and competitiveness.
   Based on the market research and the questionnaire survey, the influence
   of talents drain to construction enterprise is discussed. Talents drain
   will increase labor costs, cause loss of intangible assets, affect the
   stability of the teamwork, and lose enterprise development
   opportunities.
   The reason of construction enterprises talents drain is summarized. The
   management model of enterprise is outdated. The employee's career
   planning is unreasonable. Enterprise do not form the scientific talents
   assessment mechanism. Some employees leave the enterprise following the
   key figure. Some employees leave the enterprise because of salary and
   children' education.
   Finally, some specific measures avoiding talents drain are proposed for
   construction enterprise. We should establish a high quality leadership
   team, strengthen enterprises culture, implement kindly management,
   establish multi-unit salary system, establish competitive growth career
   planning, and carry out recruitment work successfully, etc.}},

Abstract = {{The present research results assume that end-user computing satisfaction
   (EUCS) of an enterprise resource planning system (ERP system) depends on
   users' positive perception of determinants on multiple organizational
   levels. Hence, rather than investigating a precise theory of narrow
   focus, this research addresses the users' view of the impact of major
   project and organizational issues on EUCS. This requires a multilevel
   approach to research. A hierarchical regression analysis based on data
   from 123 middle managers and super-users from a single company with
   operating units in 10 western European countries confirmed this theory.
   Still, a path analysis suggests that determinants representing the near
   user environment (communication and decision-making patterns between
   users and experts locally during the ERP system implementation process,
   and communication with peers in organizational units other than that of
   the respondent) contribute more consistently to EUCS than determinants
   on other organizational levels. User training plays a role in helping
   users understand the relevance of ERP system project business
   objectives, but training does not help in explaining EUCS. The study
   points to future research in the areas of instrument development as well
   as an increased understanding of stakeholders' views, determinant
   definitions, relationships among determinants, and measures of ERP
   system outcome. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses in-progress research examining the enterprise
   resource planning systems (ERPS) and management accounting practices
   (MAP) fit, and the relationship between the fit and user satisfaction.
   Goodhue and Thompson (13)'s Task-Technology Fit was adopted to develop a
   framework for the research. The ERPS-MAP Fit was the main construct of
   the framework which represents the fit of ERPS and MAP. Instrument
   consisting of 38 MAP items was used to measure the ERPS-MAP Fit based on
   fit-as-matching perspective. Different levels of ERPS-MAP Fit were
   determined and tested against user satisfaction. The respondents of this
   research were accounting staff of Malaysian-based oil and gas companies
   who used ERPS in performing their tasks. The survey questionnaires were
   administered through personal visit to respondents' premises. The
   significant of the research and opportunities for future research were
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigates why certain enterprise resource planning
   (ERP) system adopters have pursued high levels of software customization
   during implementation despite the generally accepted best-practice
   heuristic of limiting customization. Qualitative data from ERP adoption
   projects and consultants working with ERP implementations have been
   collected. This study empirically identifies customization drivers and
   explains their relationship to customization. The results suggest that
   high customization may occur because of: unnecessary redevelopment of
   functionality that is available in the ERP system standard, resistance
   to change based on cultural issues and low project acceptance,
   insufficient weight given to the implementation team's recommendations,
   and the implementation team's lack of opposition to customization
   requests. The results of this study also explain how these problems
   occur and why they lead to over-customization.}},

Abstract = {{The digital production and information management represent the new
   development direction of printing enterprises. As the core of digital
   printing, Job Definition Format (JDF) connects prepress, print, and
   post-press in a whole. As the core of information management, Enterprise
   Resource Planning (ERP) system is the platform which integrates all
   resources of the enterprise and provides scheme or control for
   enterprise. In the paper we study the key technology to build a
   JDF-based ERP system for printing enterprises. By using Java technology,
   an ERP system is developed which can be used on the Internet and
   integrated with the digital workflow based on JDF in printing
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Emergency management is an effective means of the enterprise controlling
   hazards and eliminating hidden danger, which can be used to take timely
   effective response measures to minimize the loss of accident once the
   accident occurs. In recent years, chemical production accidents occurred
   one after another in China. Therefore, accident emergency rescue system
   construction has become a hot issue of national concern, particularly in
   chlor-alkali enterprises, which are involved in more hazardous chemicals
   and are production and storage sites of large amount of hazardous
   substances, and in which particularly serious accidents have occurred.
   On the basis of the investigation in several chlor-alkali enterprises,
   emergency management deficiencies were identified in the chlor-alkali
   enterprises in China. Enterprise emergency management software based on
   VISUAL FOXPRO database was developed in the article, which included the
   following five modules: enterprise overview, accident types, emergency
   plan management, hazardous chemicals query and emergency resources. The
   software has been applied to some chlor-alkali enterprise, and users is
   satisfied due to its interface user-friendly and easy to operate.}},

Abstract = {{Production and logistical processes are some of the most critical
   processes in every industrial enterprise. Mastering these processes has
   a direct influence not only upon the entrepreneurial activities of
   individual firms, but also on the whole of the supplier-customer chain
   and on industrial branches as It whole. For this very reason, these
   processes have always been, are and will continue to be the centre of
   interest in the exploitation and use of modern information systems and
   technologies. ERP systems represent a key software infrastructure for
   production and logistics management. Their effective application in
   everyday working practice should however not take place without the use
   of the corresponding methods for the planning and management of
   production and logistics processes. This paper summarises the main
   observations of the Center for inVestigations into Information Systems
   (CVIS) in these fields, it provides an overview of the main results and
   outcomes of research study investigations into the Czech ERP market with
   an orientation on the planning and management methods integrated into
   the applications logic of ERP systems.}},

Abstract = {{Journal the Association for Information Systems The abundance of
   innovation concepts in the world of information technology and their
   differentiated influence on the design, production, and use of IT in
   organizations make it important that we understand what shapes these
   concepts themselves. Taking the perspective that an IT innovation
   concept emerges and evolves beyond organizational boundaries in a
   community, I argue that the prevalence or popularity of the concept in
   IT discourse positively influences the adoption of the underlying
   innovation. Then with the aim to explore what makes an IT innovation
   concept popular, my empirical analysis of the once highly popular
   concept ERP (enterprise resource planning) suggests that (1) the
   popularity of ERP was influenced positively by the prevalence of
   highlighted business problems that ERP was claimed to solve; (2) ERP's
   popularity was influenced negatively by the prevalence of related
   innovation concepts; and (3) these influences largely disappeared after
   ERP passed its peak popularity. These results imply that the popularity
   of an IT innovation concept responds to the broader climate of business
   and relies on the right type of attention drawn and released by other
   concepts in a network of concepts. Going beyond the dominant paradigm,
   this paper helps broaden IT innovation research along two new
   dimensions: toward the innovation concept, as a complement to material
   innovation, and toward community-level analysis, as an extension of the
   traditional organizational analysis. The paper also suggests that
   practitioners evaluate an innovation concept's fit with the broader
   environment and relationship with other popular concepts, as a way to
   make sense of the innovation and anticipate its impact on IT practice.

Abstract = {{Today, user training and adoption is one of the greatest hassles faced
   by companies implementing ERP. In case of inappropriate training
   program, users fail to appreciate the consequences of their actions.
   Hence, practices that worked fine in the era of standalone systems can
   have catastrophic effects on integrated ERP environments. Consequently
   appropriate user training methodology must be taken into account. This
   paper introduces a training methodology called Process-Oriented Training
   that focuses on the process-oriented nature of ERP. The main objective
   of this methodology is to eventually present a user training technique
   in which the users are clear about their roles and impacts on business
   processes. Insights from analysis of a number of case studies are used
   to validate the importance of user training and impact of
   process-oriented training in ERP implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Make-to-stock and Make-to-order are two generic operation modes commonly
   used in the manufacturing world. The make-to-order enterprise makes the
   production systems to produce a product only after it is ordered. The
   enterprise must decide which orders can be accepted to get the optimal
   profit and meet the due time. This paper addresses a order mix decision
   model in a make-to-order operation environment. The mathematical model
   is proposed to select a set of customer orders to maximize the
   operational profit such that all the selected orders are fulfilled by
   their deadline. With a given capacity limit on each resource type and
   its cost rate, solving this model leads to an optimal production mix for
   the orders over a given time horizon. The conclusion shows that it is
   not a optimal choice to accept all customer's orders although they can
   be produced before deadline. This paper tells the enterprise how to
   select the order mix according to the cost and production capacity
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{The core of ERP is to realize effective management of the whole supply
   chain, which is mainly embodied by management of resources of whole
   supply chain, lean production, concurrent works, agile manufacturing,
   in-advance planning and intermediate control. The coal enterprise
   management concept has been transformed due to the introduction of ERP.
   Coal production is an important activity which is decisive for the
   generation of value of coal product. The management of production and
   operation of coal enterprise is relative backward at present and there
   are many unreasonable internal business processes, therefore,
   implementation of ERP based on advanced management concept and computer
   technology will fundamentally change the existing management modes and
   methods. E-business helps to effectively realize ERP of coal enterprise
   and improve the informatization level and competitiveness of coal
   enterprise. The necessity of implementing ERP in coal enterprise was
   analyzed, so is the structure of ERP system of coal enterprise in
   e-business environment. In addition, application of e-business based ERP
   in coal enterprise was discussed.}},
