Abstract = {{The process of implementation of ERP is influenced not only by internal
   factors (resources of an organisation and the system itself), but also
   factors of the micro- and macro-environment. Implementation of
   enterprise resource planning systems is a complex process influenced by
   a large number of internal and external components. The aim of this
   article is to investigate the peculiarities of the process of
   implementation of enterprise resource planning systems and to establish
   the critical factors of the success. In order to establish the opinion
   of Lithuanian ERP specialists and users regarding the importance of the
   factors determining the result of implementation of ERP the survey was
   conducted. Experts of ERP implementation consider as the most important
   factors determining the Success Of implementation the management factors
   relating to such fields as management. planning, implementation and
   control of projects and organisational changes.}},

Abstract = {{According to the problem that the planning model of existing ERP system
   is unable to suit for the current situation that the coal enterprise
   have the indefinite production environment, and does not have fixed bill
   of material, the model of production plan optimization in coal
   enterprise based on BP-MOP was established, combining the characteristic
   of material resources consumption and the decision-making of production
   planning; The simulation analysis was carried using Matlab 6. 5, it was
   indicated that the model can forecast the consumption rate of all kinds
   of material and resource accurately and then get good solution of
   multiple object planning, so the model can apply in ERP system of coal
   enterprise very well; The model put forward a new method of building and
   studying ERP system in coal enterprise.}},

   and explain how organisations, which have different roles in the
   value-chain in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system
   dcvelopment/implementation project, receive competitive advantage from
   selling or using ERPs. This discussion relates to the on-going
   discussion about bow organisations receive competitive advantage from
   information and communication technology (ICT), and from that and by the
   influence from the resource-based view a set of propositions related to
   ERP development and competitive advantage and what role different
   stakeholders play in the value-chain are presented. These propositions
   have the ambition of acting as a foundation for future research on
   development and implementation of ERPs and if and if so, how the
   different stakeholders' different ways of receiving competitive
   advantage influence ERP development and especially when it comes to
   development of a more standardized or pre-customized ERP system. The
   propositions also act as a foundation for increasing the knowledge about
   reasons for why developing a future ``better{''} ERP system is that

Abstract = {{Globalization and mass-customization is shaping a new kind of e-business
   for manufacturing and service organizations alike. Enterprises are
   strongly conditioned by unpredictable changes in the markets. The
   raising question is how to provide efficient, cost-effective and
   customer-oriented solutions on time. In fact, current systems such as
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management (SCM) do
   not provide adequate facilities for addressing this problem. This paper
   conceptualizes how multiplatform integration may contribute to the
   evolving new phenomenon, i.e. global enterprise resource planning (GERP)
   systems. We are talking about perspectives of merging multi-agent
   approach with the ERP and SCM platforms, where communication framework
   is facilitated by the field-based model adopted from the recent advances
   in the robotics research. Intuitive reasoning behind it is based upon
   behavior of complex social networks, where are prevailing not
   pair-to-pair interactions among agents, but rather field-like medium for
   the effective information exchange. The paper examines each approach
   consequently and gives some clues how merging of different approaches
   may contribute to the achievement of better communication results for
   GERP.}},

Abstract = {{An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system acquisition and
   implementation is a strategic decision that can significantly affect
   future competitiveness and performance of a company. This increases the
   criticality of this decision. Though several SMEs have taken the ERP
   implementation decision. they don't use a formal procedure for selecting
   an ERP system. The awareness amongst SMEs for ERP is very low and very
   few know how they can benefit from an ERP system.
   Many SMEs believe that ERP systems are meant only for large enterprises
   on account of the cost and the complexity involved in the
   implementation. There are others who consider ERP to be a magic wand
   that will solve all their problems. While some SMEs decide to acquire a
   particular ERP solely because their competitor has done so, others
   approach the selection as they would any other software. Thus, most ERP
   decisions are taken without proper consideration and without aligning
   ERP with business goals. This oft times results in a system that meets
   but part of a company's requirements. In this paper, the authors have
   proposed a framework to help SMEs select an ERP system with care,
   The framework is based on the insights gained from a study carried out
   at 6 SMEs who have acquired an ERP system and have implemented or are
   currently implementing it. In-depth interviews were conducted with IT
   personnel, CEOs and others at these SMEs to understand the procedure
   adopted in selecting an ERP system. This was aided by an extensive
   review of literature. Thus, this paper presents the current selection
   procedure used by the six SMEs and proposes a systematic approach to ERP
   acquisition that SMEs can adopt to ensure that the ERP system selected
   offers a better fit to their requirements.}},

Abstract = {{An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a complex network
   composed of various business processes. This paper proposes methods
   based on stochastic-flow network model to analysis the capacity
   sensitivity of persons with respect to the performance of an ERP system.
   The nodes in the network denote the persons responsible for the business
   tasks during the processes. The arcs between nodes denote the process
   precedence relationships in the ERP system. The performance of an ERP
   system is then related to the flow of the documents through the network.
   To analyze the person's impact against the system performance, the
   increasing-capacity contributivity analysis and the decreasing-capacity
   impairment analysis are conducted. Some interesting findings are
   obtained. For example, the strategy of increasing capacity will not
   promise to contribute performance. However, the strategy of decreasing
   capacity will also not always to impair performance. Numerical examples
   for these analyses are illustrated in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{In order to solve the problems in general purpose enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) systems such as large scale, thousands of configuration
   parameters, low adaptation to specific industry, etc, the concept of
   industry oriented ERP (IERP) was advanced. Then, a software
   componentization approach for IERP systems was developed. A meta-model
   for IERP componentization was put forward and business components of
   IERP were classified. In order to improve the operability of component
   assembly based IERP development, a platform framework for developing
   IERP software was introduced, which consisted of five parts, i.e. server
   layer, multi-team supporting layer, software development and
   customization layer, reusable assets and toolsets, and IERP software
   instance layer. Each part was discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Business rule management systems are used to automate and support
   decisions in business processes. One of the main business management
   systems peculiarities is a slow and resource consuming implementation,
   which causes latency between business policy confirmation by dedicated
   authority and implementation into the software systems of enterprise
   information system. On the other hand, changes in information system
   processes supporting business should appear in conjunction with business
   policy changes. In such circumstances, the topical problem is the fast
   readjustment of business management systems, approaching zero latency.
   Separation of business rules from the software system of information
   system code is one of the ways to solve this problem. However the
   architecture of enterprise resource planning systems usually does not
   support this method. This paper presents a method based on business rule
   transformation into the active database management system triggers and
   deployment of them into an active database management system, which is a
   part of a business management system.}},

Abstract = {{With the fast developing knowledge economy, one of the major challenges
   facing enterprise managers is aligning knowledge management (KM) with
   business strategy and processes, especially after an enterprise has
   applied Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). Since knowledge sharing
   (KnS) is one of the most critical steps in KM activities, it is
   necessary to study the effective sharing of tacit knowledge in ERP
   enterprises. In an ERP environment, KnS system should have two
   functions. One is to support the enterprise business and die other is to
   support employees' communication. Most researches have thus far focused
   on the first function trying to find out management mechanism to improve
   the effect of KnS while ignoring the other function. In the KnS with the
   communication function, this research finds out that knowledge is
   exchanged naturally and freely. The KnS system can also make employees
   feel better about their work by making greater contribution to building
   an active culture environment to support knowledge exchange. In this
   paper, these two types of KnS are called business-oriented
   knowledge-sharing and subject-oriented knowledge-sharing. It also
   designs their constructions, propose their management mechanism and
   discuss some relevant practice problems. When these two types of KnS are
   applied in ERP enterprises they not only can provide channels for
   employees to exchange knowledge, but can also help enterprises to get
   tacit knowledge from ERP users and to make tacit knowledge more
   effectively be converted to explicit knowledge. Though ERP and KnS are
   performed as two separate systems, this research provides guidance to
   enterprise managers to develop tacit knowledge-sharing system on their
   ERP implementation and keep the same goal with it.}},

Abstract = {{Chinese firms heavily invest in enterprise resource planning systems
   (ERP) in recent years and expect that ERP can help them gain superior
   financial performance. Given the high costs and high risk of ERP
   investments, to quantify the financial benefits of ERP implementation is
   an important research issue. This paper empirically examines the impacts
   of ERP implementation on firm performance using the financial data from
   50 Chinese chemical firms that implemented ERP. The firms' abnormal
   performance during the two-year implementation period and three-year
   post-implementation period was analyzed based on the guideline of Barber
   et al. on event studies. The results find no significant performance
   improvement during the implementation period and the three-year
   post-implementation period and a decline in performance in the first two
   years after implementation. However, a slight performance improvement in
   the third year after implementation may indicate that the financial
   benefits of ERP may show after a long-term ERP use. These results
   provide insight for Chinese firms that want to invest in ERP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper seeks to ascertain how the turnover factors, vender features
   and industrial characteristics improve the firm efficiency under
   enterprise resources planning (ERP) systems. A comparison of DEA
   efficiency score is conducted between pre-ERP and post-ERP phases based
   on 59 Taiwanese firms which implement ERP from 1998 to 2003. ERP
   adopters are found to reduce their turnover days of account receivables
   or inventories, and prolong turnover days of unpaid accounts permitted
   by their suppliers, thus causing a substantial efficiency elevation
   after ERP implementation. In addition, this article captures the greater
   efficiency advance based upon leading vendor packages. This suggests
   that the rapid efficiency growth under ERP formula is closely connected
   with the consulting supports of leading vendors. Furthermore, the
   electronics industry performs better than non-electronics Industry after
   ERP installation, which implies ``electronics firms' more reliance on
   such ERP mechanisms{''} to effectively integrate resources, and as a
   result enhance performance.}},

Abstract = {{Greater interdependence among workers and activities not only increases
   the need for internal communication, but it also imposes complications
   and barriers to effective information exchange. Intraorganizational
   communication capabilities of certain information systems can help
   overcome these barriers. However, the extent to which certain systems
   are promoted as communication tools depends largely on management's
   interpretation of their usefulness, which in turn may be largely
   dependent on operational context and managerial experience. We use a
   controlled experimental approach to study how these issues interact to
   impact managerial assessments of resource planning systems. Results show
   that managers value the communication capabilities of resource planning
   systems more so in highly task-interdependent contexts and that these
   assessments are still more positive among managers with greater
   supervisory experience. As a result, these findings pose direct
   implications regarding the management support of technology use.}},

Abstract = {{More and more companies are implementing their Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP) project to build their competence in the tense market.
   But the failure rate of such implementation is very high, especially in
   China. The reason is that most companies don't use Business Process
   Reengineering (BPR) to change the operating process but overly depend on
   ERP to change the resources and logical systems. In fact, the
   introduction of the ERP package would be a kind of BPR because work
   habits are tuned in to the functions of the ERP package. The
   implementation of ERP must suit to the BPR, and get the support of BPR.
   The ERP package must be selected to meet the company's BPR themes. By
   comparing some models of ERP and BPR, the thesis builds a new model to
   implement ERP under BPR context.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP)systems have become widely applied in
   all types of organizations today. Unfortunately, the success rate of ERP
   implementations is very low, which was cited in many researches and the
   majority of authors have reported up to 90\% failure rate. Therefore,
   new studies are more than necessary to validate companies' contributions
   to the increase of the success rate of ERP implementation, which was the
   primary reason for our investigation. The main goal of this paper is to
   stress the impact of business process Management and some other critical
   success factors at? successful ERP implementations. Empirical
   investigation and a confirmatory approach using structural equation
   modeling (SEM) has been used. The research hypotheses that top
   management support, change management and business process management
   have a positive impact on successful ERP implementation were confirmed.
   These factors should be treated as very important in ERP. systems
   implementation projects. The results also support the importance of top
   management perception: if they consider business process management as a
   basis of business change, this contributes to a strong and positive
   influence of successful ERP implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since 1979 when China launched its open-door policy and reforms,
   there have been many enterprises running business across the Straits
   among the Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. As a result of differences in
   existing judicial systems, personnel management, social/commercial
   culture, and particularly the risk-aversion strategies taken by the
   Taiwanese enterprises in the forms of multi-offices, -plants and
   -operating-sites, the modus operandi of the cross-Strait enterprises is
   far more complex than ordinary international business.
   The effective means to implement Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is
   no exception to this concern. The recent many researches on ERP cannot
   be taken for granted for those cross-Strait business cases in that the
   previous findings related to factors for success will not be sustainable
   in structurally heterogeneous environment.
   To fill the gap and suit the characters of a heterogeneous information
   system, this research takes a field study by looking into an electronic
   company that is seen as one of the forerunners of cross-Strait
   enterprises in Taiwan and tries, in its first step, to build a
   theoretical model that may be applicable for ERP in a heterogeneous
   environment.
   The paper then proceeds with this model to fish for existing problems
   faced by those cross-Strait enterprises through questionnaires. By
   collecting the results after the survey, the paper will falsify its
   model initially built at the first stage and re-construct a mature one,
   with which it will sort out the factors of effective ERP that the
   cross-Strait enterprise in Taiwan should not neglect. The paper finally
   reports that external factors including different laws and cultural
   differences, and internal factors including communications and operation
   processes are vital for Successful ERP. Preparation before entering ERP
   is also a factor worthy of note.
   The paper in conclusion part argues that proper understanding of the
   factors to ERP for the cross-Strait enterprises in Taiwan can be an
   indispensable part of comprehensive research on multi-national
   corporations in general.}},

   were gathered from different actors involved in the implementation of
   enterprise's ABC and ERP projects. Our study focuses on the ontological
   politics {[}Mol, A.-M., 1999. Ontological politics. A word and some

   After. Blackwell, Malden, MA, pp. 74-89] required for the creation of a

   (one division of the enterprise), the new agency was labelled `virtual
   integration', its purpose being to enable a new vision of the
   profitability of the division's production chain. Our results highlight
   the unstable and complex nature of such systems, which no doubt impedes
   their use. We contribute to the understanding of such systems, with a
   special emphasis on the use of metaphors in the political process that
   accounting information systems must pass through in order to become
   established as an enterprise-wide management tool. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a complex network
   composed of various business processes. This paper proposes a method
   based on stochastic-flow network model to evaluate the performance of an
   ERP system depending upon the results of the ERP examination of the
   users involved. The nodes in the network denote the persons responsible
   for the business tasks during the processes. The arcs between nodes
   denote the process precedence relationships in the ERP system. When the
   process starts, the documents are initiated from the source node to its
   succeeding nodes. Finally, the documents are released in the destination
   node. Thus, the performance of an ERP system is related to the flow of
   the documents through the network. The failure of an ERP system is
   therefore described as in the condition that the flow of the system is
   tinder the acceptable level d. We propose a performance index, the
   probability of the maximal flow not less than d, to evaluate the
   performance of an ERP system. An algorithm is subsequently proposed to
   generate the performance index, which can be used to assess the system
   performance either before or after the system going live.}},

Abstract = {{The use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to deploy the
   panoptic gaze remains unresearched in the UK. Though there are studies
   outside the UK which use panoptic theory to investigate ERP systems,
   they do not analyse the influence the interaction between ERP technology
   and organisational culture have on the development of the panoptic gaze.
   The aim emerging from these issues was to understand whether ERP
   technology, organisational culture, or a combination of both could
   support development of the panoptic gaze in an organisation from the UK.
   The method selected was a qualitative case study of a UK organisation's
   finance division, and the techniques used were semi-structured
   interviews and observations. The study suggests the ERP technology
   provided an infrastructure from which the panoptic gaze could be
   deployed. It was not deployed in this instance however, as the finance
   division's culture did not emphasise workforce surveillance. The study
   therefore suggests that in addition to ERP technology a culture
   emphasising workforce surveillance was needed to develop the panoptic
   gaze. The findings support the social shaping concept as it was the
   finance division's cultural context that influenced whether the ERP
   technology would be used to deploy the panoptic gaze. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{While fierce competition impels many of the commercial markets into a
   low-profit environment, virtual enterprise (VE) appears as a business
   strategy for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to alley
   together. However, to support the operations of a VE, a resource
   planning system (RPS) is required. In this study, a systematic and
   hierarchical approach which consists of top-down modeling and bottom-up
   implementation steps is proposed and used for developing the RPS.
   Following this approach, a Predicate/Transition (Pr/ Tr) net model for
   resource planning is derived. In addition, activity-based costing (ABC)
   is applied to provide a financial measure, profit, which is believed to
   be more meaningful in a collaborative environment. The Pr/Tr net model
   is further transformed into Horn clauses, and implemented by a logical
   programming language, Visual Prolog. Finally, a RPS which contains
   graphical user interface, model and knowledge database is developed. In
   the RPS, the goals and dispatching rules call be easily included and
   evaluated. In addition, the schedules based oil the best dispatching
   rule can be generated. An example of horizontal collaborative
   manufacturing is used to illustrate the application of the RPS and the
   generation of the schedules. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While early cited benefits of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or
   enterprise systems remain for the most part highly desirable, it is
   often the case that the promise of delivery differs from reality. Many
   now agree that achieving enterprise systems benefits is complex,
   cumbersome, risky and expensive. Furthermore many ERP projects do not
   fully achieve expectations. This paper takes a critical lens to the
   prospect of a firm achieving enterprise systems' benefits and presents
   the findings of a case study that examines the underlying managerial and
   organizational reasons of one multi-national enterprise for, at least,
   postponing ERP implementation. It reveals a rich picture of
   implementation motivators, inhibitors and the perceived and real
   benefits of enterprise systems.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are costly and complex but
   vital for companies having to face a rapidly changing business
   environment and an increasingly competitive marketplace. As the first
   study to examine the factors within the
   technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework that affect the
   decision to adopt ERP in Taiwan's communications industry, the empirical
   tests conducted here are based on personal interviews with a sample of
   99 firms in Taiwan's communications industry. Eight factors in three
   broad categories are tested using logistic regression, and four of
   these, technology readiness, size, perceived barriers and production and
   operations improvements, are found to be important determinants of the
   adoption of ERP. This model correctly classifies 79.8\% of the decisions
   made with respect to the adoption of ERP. The results substantiate the
   usefulness of this model which may be interesting to managers seeking to
   be more proactive in planning for their adoption of an ERP system.}},

Abstract = {{Existing enterprise modeling architectures can not provide effective
   support on expressing and reusing industrial knowledge. Industrial
   knowledge reuse oriented enterprise modeling for integrated management
   information systems (MIS) should be located between general purpose
   enterprise modeling and concrete enterprise application scheme, and an
   enterprise modeling framework for integrated MIS which is industrial
   knowledge reuse oriented is put forward in this paper. In this
   framework, a new lifecycle dimension was constructed by extending
   traditional lifecycle dimension and combing the multiple views mechanism
   of ARIS, knowledge reuse dimension was introduced to support the
   modeling and reusing industrial knowledge, and the language, methodology
   and tools dimension was introduced to express the sets of languages,
   methods and tools used in constructing, validating, maintaining and
   evolving enterprise models. Finally, the cement production industry was
   adopted as an example to illustrate how the framework can be employed to
   guide the reuse of industrial knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Most of enterprises in China have stepped on the Nolan-Stage IV:
   integration of information systems. The most dominant characteristic of
   Nolan-Stage IV is the rethinking of the role of the information resource
   in organizational goal achievement and it is an optimum opportunity of
   implementation of IRP (Information Resource Planning). In this effort,
   there are cases of successful and unsuccessful implementations. The
   paper takes an in-depth look at the issues behind the process of IRP
   implementation via a case study methodology. It focuses on business and
   technical as well as cultural issues at the heart of the IRP
   implementation. The case study also looks at the implementation time
   scales and assesses the benefits from the project both tangible and
   intangible. This paper examines key dimensions of IRP within a large
   enterprise organization and identifies core issues to confront in
   successful implementation of IRP. A brief overview of the current
   enterprise applications and information systems in Tianjin Port are also
   presented.}},

Title = {{A composite framework of supply chain management and enterprise planning
   for small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises}},
Journal = {{SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{349-355}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the factors which influence the
   ability of SMEs to align their enterprise-planning systems with the
   requirements and constraints of supply chain relationships in order to
   meet their own and their customers' strategic and operational
   requirements. The objectives are to: identify the range of trading
   relationships that exist between an SME in the manufacturing sector and
   its customers and suppliers; examine the implications of these external
   relationships for the SME's internal enterprise-planning system; develop
   a composite framework of enterprise planning and supply chain management
   which allows manufacturing SMEs to understand how these interact and can
   be aligned.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper develops a composite framework
   that allows first- or second-tier manufacturing SMEs to identify the
   types of relationships in which they are involved and how they can
   understand and address their internal arrangements in order to meet
   their external obligations. In developing a composite framework, the
   primary objective is to understand how short-term enterprise planning
   and supply chain trading relationships interact.
   Findings - The paper has shown the developed understanding of aligning
   trading relationships and enterprise planning for the benefit of the
   supply chain. It has shown the importance of a manufacturing SME's
   strategic and operational requirements in achieving this alignment.
   Research limitations/implications - The next stage of the research is to
   undertake an in-depth longitudinal case study of a number of
   manufacturing SMEs with the aim of gaining a greater understanding of
   the issues emanating from the developed composite framework. Since these
   mechanisms will be the responsibility of a small group of people within
   the SME it is planned to collect data that focus on the interactions of
   both short-term operational issues and a longer-term strategic view
   within each of the selected businesses.
   Practical implications - A manufacturing SME's strategic and operational
   requirements may be an area where those supplying products upstream have
   an advantage over their bigger manufacturing brethren. For a
   manufacturing SME, these issues and mechanisms will be the
   responsibility of only a few people whose interactions are likely to
   focus on short-term issues, but they can begin to move their perspective
   from day-to-day pressures and take a more holistic, long-term view of
   the business. By so doing, they can achieve a more effective alignment
   of external and internal requirements and mechanisms which will benefit
   themselves, their customers and the entire supply chain.
   Originality/value - This composite framework of supply chain management
   and enterprise planning should enable those who run manufacturing SMEs
   to take an overview of their business and better align their internal
   priorities with the external requirements of their customers.
   Understanding these convergent topics is central to improving supply
   chain performance.}},

Abstract = {{Is total quality management (TQM) a predecessor of enterprise resource
   planning systems (ERP) implementation? This question draws a lot of
   interest from business managers. Many firms intend to implement both TQM
   and ERP systems to match the market competition. The question is: Which
   system should be implemented first? Using US manufacturing companies
   that have a focus on TQM and have implemented ERP systems, this study
   examines the relationship among TQM, ERP implementation, operations
   performance, customer satisfaction, and a firm's performance and
   subsequently provides a better understanding about the synergistic
   relationship between TQM and ERP implementation. Structural equation
   modeling is applied to analyze the data from 154 manufacturing companies
   in the US. We argue that TQM is a philosophy that emphasizes process
   improvement, whereas an ERP system is an IT mechanism that implements
   enterprise-wide process management. Conceptual development and our
   findings suggest ERP implementation can be successful if it is preceded
   by a TQM focus. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   processes. The proposed novel approach represents an agile and flexible
   technology framework based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The
   authors demonstrate the utility of the approach by implementing a
   solution to integrate the Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) and stock

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are an application software
   implemented in a great number of manufacturing companies worldwide. The
   implementation of an ERP system is performed to integrate business
   processes, allocate company's resources efficiently and provide
   important data for decision support. Implementing an ERP system is
   expensive and time-consuming. A lot of research activities are focused
   on key success factors of ERP implementations. But what does a
   successful implementation of an ERP system mean? If an ERP project is
   completed according to the schedule, the budget was not exceeded and the
   scope was realized, does this mean that the implementation was
   successful? The implementation of an ERP system is a long-term
   undertaking, and not only a short-term project that is finished just
   after the system installation. Especially for a project driven
   enterprise that realizes engineer-to-order production, the evaluation
   should encompass a long period of time. In this article a methodology of
   ER-P system implementation dedicated for project driven enterprises is
   presented. The methodology is based on a set of assumptions and
   limitations that enable to indicate if the strategic goal of the ERP
   implementation is reached. The evaluation of ERP projects is based on
   the calculation of different productivity ratios of the enterprise in
   several periods. An illustrative example is given.}},

Abstract = {{Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that can effectively reduce
   product cost, improve customer service experience, and increase
   enterprise competitiveness is one of the most significant information
   systems for Chinese enterprises. However, the successful implementation
   rate of ERP system is much lower than initially planned and many
   enterprises did not achieve their intended goals. There are a lot of
   factors (e.g., high implementation costs, technical complexity, lack of
   well-trained employees, lack of incentive mechanisms, etc.) resulting in
   this. situation, but the key element is the separation of the
   relationship between ERP system and enterprise leadership,
   organizational structure and business processes. Aiming at the key
   issue, an IT governance framework of ERP system implementation is
   developed based on information technology governance methodology, which
   includes six components (i.e., enterprise strategy and organization,
   ERP-related organization and desirable behavior, ERP-related governance
   arrangements, ERP-related governance mechanisms, ERP-related business
   performance goal, ERP-related metrics and accountabilities.). The
   requirements of each component are described. Furthermore, a case of ERP
   system implementation is used to illustrate the proposed framework,
   which takes into account sufficiently the relationships among ERP
   system, business objectives, business processes, and business
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{While more and more companies plan to implement asset management
   solutions to control supply chain costs and public sectors strive for
   effective and timely management of public facilities, there are
   significant moves coming to improve both asset management processes and
   the information technology (IT) that support them. In the arena of IT,
   Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of the most promising
   technologies to improve the effectiveness of asset management. In this
   research we propose an RFID and ERP enabled Mobile Asset Management
   Information System (MAMIS) that will produce real value in the form of
   reduced costs, staff productivity, and effective management today. The
   proposed system was designed for tagging valuable assets or equipment,
   providing asset location information, auditing and triggering for

Abstract = {{Presently the ERP software market is characterized by a fierce
   competition of some of the largest software producers of the world.
   While SAP tries to defend its position as the market leader, Oracle,
   founded as database vendor, has heavily invested into its ERP business
   by taking over large related software producers like Peoplesoft or
   Siebel. Microsoft also bought ERP vendors as a basis for its MBS
   (Microsoft Business Solution) division. IBM and Sage are further players
   in the multi-billion market of ERP software. Currently the market faces
   two big challenges. (1) The classic ERP market addressing large
   corporations has become mature and is characterized by growth through
   displacement today. However the ERP market for SME still promises big
   growth rates. (2) The classic monolithic ERP systems are presently
   replaced by new middleware based technologies that provide open
   platforms to easily integrate business applications of third party
   software producers. Network externalities will significantly influence
   which ERP vendor(s) will dominate the future market. Therefore we will
   qualitatively analyse the current strengths and weaknesses of the
   presently most promising ERP producer with respect to network
   externalities.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of information technology and the gradual
   extension of information technology to enterprise, ERP systems become
   more and more complex and some new requirements that focus on both
   manufacturing activities and the supply chain are brought forward. To
   address these problems, a MAERP system architecture based on agent and
   SOA has been developed. To illustrate the architecture, an experiment
   system has been proposed in detail. This simulation implied that the
   architecture provides a very efficient method to design ERP systems for
   small \& medium-size Enterprises with the purposes of flexibility to
   achieve the business agility, reusability of the intelligent component,
   and cooperation between application systems to assure a global
   optimization. The objectives of this paper is to illustrate the
   architecture of ERP systems based on agent for small \& medium-size
   Enterprises, and the approach of bow a web services-based SOA supports
   our MAERP system.}},

Abstract = {{The general objective of this work was to study the contribution of the
   ERP for the quality of the managerial accounting information, through
   the perception of managers of large sized Brazilian companies. The
   initial principle was that, presently, we live in an enterprise reality
   characterized by global and competitive worldwide scenery where the
   information about the enterprise performance and the evaluation of the
   intangible assets are necessary conditions for the survival, of the
   companies. The research of the exploratory type is based on a sample of
   37 managers of large sized-Brazilian companies. The analysis of the data
   treated by means of the qualitative method showed that the great
   majority of the companies of the sample (86\%) possess an ERP implanted.
   It also showed that this system is used in combination with other
   applicative software. The managers, in its majority, were also satisfied
   with the information generated in relation to the dimensions Time and
   Content. However, with regard to the qualitative nature of the
   information, the ERP made some analysis possible when the Balanced
   Scorecard was adopted, but information able to provide an estimate of
   the investments carried through in the intangible assets was not
   obtained. These results Suggest that in these companies ERP systems are
   not adequate to support strategic decisions.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1990s there was considerable growth in implementations of
   Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems. Companies expected these
   systems to support many of the day to day business transactions. The
   growth in ERP implementations bad a resultant impact on the demand for
   ERP skills. Many universities recognized this demand and the potential
   of using ERP Systems software as a teaching tool, and endeavoured to
   incorporate ERP systems into their curriculum; however most universities
   have struggled in this task. The ERP skill shortage has reached an all
   time high especially in the Asian region. ERP vendors are investigating
   how to best address this shortfall and the role of universities. This
   paper outlines two approaches to the delivery of ERP (SAP) education in

Abstract = {{Many manufacturing companies in China today have deployed e-business
   extensively in their enterprise value chains. More research has
   accounted for the strategic planning as a crucial stage for the adoption
   of e-business. This paper investigates causal relationship between
   e-business strategy and IT resources so as to probe into the process of
   integrated e-business strategic planning. According to the model of
   e-business value creation process, we develop a series of hypotheses
   that link strategy and resource in the planning process from the
   resource-based view (RBV). With the survey data from 210 firms in China,
   we make an empirical research for demonstrating the process from the
   strategy initiative to integrated utilization of resources. We find that
   e-business strategy initiative exhibits a positive effect on the
   utilization of IT resources and human resources play a core role in the
   integration of IT resources. Examining the process of integrated
   strategic planning extends the RBV in the area of strategic management.
   It also provides the scientific basis for decision making to
   successfully deploy and utilize the firm resource through the strategic
   planning of e-business.}},

Abstract = {{Mergers and Acquisitions (M\&A) are very important for the external
   growth of companies and tend to have a very high profile in the media.
   The recent proposed acquisition of Yahoo by Microsoft is a case in
   point. However, research in finance has shown that many M\&A initiatives
   fail in terms of the expected financial outcome. The reasons for failure
   include cultural problems and a lack of operative integration, which can
   be at least partially related to problems with Enterprise Resource
   Planning (ERP) systems integration.
   Despite the high importance and profile of M\&A in the finance
   literature, surprisingly little IS research has looked at how different
   ERP systems might be integrated in the case of M\&A. Therefore this
   paper suggests a preliminary model for ERP systems integration in M\&A.
   The model is based on the research literature related to M\&A, ERP
   systems, and interviews with M\&A professionals.}},

Abstract = {{The success of Enterprise Information System implementation has become a
   major management concern. Different methodologies have been proposed to
   evaluate Enterprise System (ES) success. Some researchers have
   emphasized the need for evaluating the ES success from the viewpoints of
   several stakeholder groups. These stakeholders typically have several
   and often conflicting objectives and priorities. The goal of this study
   is to determine whether differences exist between two organizational
   stakeholder groups (IS function staff and end-users) concerning their
   evaluation of measures relating to the success of their Enterprise
   System. Several differences were found. Some results support and some
   contradict previous studies. This study also proposes new dimensions and
   measures for the ES success assessment model. More research is needed to
   construct a more comprehensive ES success assessment model to include
   the perspectives of all essential stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{Special attention to critical Success factors in the implementation of
   Enterprise Resource Planning systems is evident from the bulk of
   literature on this issue. In order to implement these systems that are
   aimed at improving the sharing of enterprise-wide information and
   knowledge, organizations Must have the capability of effective knowledge
   sharing to start with. Based on a review of the literature on the
   knowledge management in enterprise system implementation projects, this
   paper identifies two major areas of concern regarding the management of
   knowledge in this specific type of projects: managing tacit knowledge,
   and issues regarding the process-based nature of organizational
   knowledge viewed through the lens of organizational memory. The more
   capable an organization is in handling these issues, the more likely it
   is that the implementation will result in competitive advantage for the
   organization. The competitive advantage arises from the organization's
   capabilities in internalizing and integrating the adopted processes with
   the existing knowledge paradigms and harmonizing the new system and the
   organizational culture towards getting the most out of the
   implementation effort. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to examine conditions under which investment in
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) has a positive influence on business
   performance. Our empirical analysis on Korean firms that invested in ERP
   systems reveals how organizational integration modes need to be aligned
   with ERP systems for positive results from the ERP investment.
   Organizational integration modes refer to simultaneously used methods -
   people, standardization, and centralization by which an organization
   coordinates and controls the activities of different departments within
   the same organization. The degree of alignment between ERP and
   integration modes is determined by the clarity of the ERP objectives,
   and positive results in terms of operational efficiency are correlated
   with the degree of alignment between ERP and these three integration
   modes.}},
